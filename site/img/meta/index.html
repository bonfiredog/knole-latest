      <span id="frontpagepara1"><p>As a practice-based PhD, Project <span class="knole">knole</span> seeks to embody research, and new knowledge, in a work of art; an artwork which explores my research topics through the story of the young woman who wrote the words above.</p></span>

      <div id="headerline3"><img src="img/meta/line.png" /></div>

      <p>This is a facsimile of the opening page of a pamphlet, printed in the city of Sheffield in the closing months of 1760. Commonly known as 'chapbooks' or 'chaps'<a href="#fn1"><sup id="sup1">1</sup></a>, such works were coarse, mass-produced vectors of news, rumour, popular myth and cultural instruction; commonly sold to the vast class of people too poor, too illiterate or too isolated to participate in the 'literary' culture of the day<a href="#fn2"><sup id="sup2">2</sup></a>. Anne Latch, the author of this particular pamphlet, did not want her words so widely distributed. She gave her publishers strict instructions to print only one copy, and deliver it to its rightful owner; a man she had seen in her dreams, a prosperous citizen of Sheffield to whom she wished to leave everything she owned, including her story. The publishers, quite understandably thinking of their <a href="#publishermark">bottom line</a>, ignored her and printed hundreds.</p>

      <p>On the face of it, Anne's bequeathment was no great prize, for its 'rightful' owner or for anybody else who came to claim it. She owned only a cottage in the hamlet of Nighthead, high up on the dun, misty gritstone moors above Sheffield's western edge. Nighthead was a lonely place, without much character; consisting of a few waterlogged fields, a sneeze of ever-wet houses and the dwarfish, gnarled church which served them. Its only attraction was the River Night, which rose in a wood just north of the hamlet and flowed through it. Some ten years earlier an enormous cotton mill had been built downstream, harnessing the river's energy as it dropped from Edge to Edge to power some of the earliest spinning and carding machines of the Industrial Revolution<a href="#fn3"><sup id="sup3">3</sup></a>. The mill was owned by the powerful Knole family, and employed almost the entire population of Nighthead; until that year, Anne counted amongst them.</p>

      <p>The house itself was, arguably, the least appealing in a settlement of unappealing homes. It came with a half-acre of land, but was entirely paved with thick, interlocking slabs of hard flagstone, through which not even the most tenacious weeds could penetrate. It received little sun, and with its arm-thick walls and the lack of glass in its few windows, visitors could see their breath in its shadowed air even in summer. It barely contained a stick of furniture, and there was not even a hearth; instead, in its place could be found a long crack in the yellowing daub of the kitchen wall, as high as a man's thigh and wide enough to peer inside.</p>

      <p>Anne's chapbook is the narrative of that crack, and what she found inside it; a <i>"spyrit"</i>, a mysterious and paranatural creature that lived inside the house's walls, and whose presence came to change Anne's life irrevocably over the course of a single year. Responsive to auspicious events and attuned to certain portentous words, phrases and arrangements, Anne began to use the creature as her familiar or magical companion<a href="#fn4"><sup id="sup4">4</sup></a> (as well as a source of ingredients) for a series of rituals and spells designed to assuage the fears, heal the wounds and bless the enterprises of her neighbours. Eventually, she was able to emancipate herself from her work at the mill, becoming a <i>"soilwarp"</i>, in the local slang; a cunning woman, healer and soothsayer<a href="#fn5"><sup id="sup5">5</sup></a> whose clients came from across the country to sit before the crack in her kitchen, meet with the curious character who lived there, and be cured of whatever ailed them.</p>

      <p>Arranged as a grimoire, recipe book and instructional to her inheritor, Anne's chapbook, what she called her <i>Housekeeping</i>, provides a fragmentary understanding of her extraordinary year; a glimpsed image of a society, and a woman, in transition, powered by a being barely witnessed in the candlelight.</p>

      <p>The <i>Housekeeping</i> forms one half of Project <span class="knole">knole</span>, and Anne's story. In structure, content and style it serves as a guide to the other half of the artwork; an installation piece consisting of a real-time, computational simulation of the 'spyrit' itself. Responsive to your words, touch and other stimuli as varied as the weather and the church calendar, and possessed of its own mien, mood and emotions, you will be able to <i>"come to know"</i><a href="#fn6"><sup id="sup6">6</sup></a> the creature in many of the same ways that Anne came to know it; through the rituals and rites described in the <i>Housekeeping</i>, through observation and through your own manual curiosity. So doing, you will understand her story in several different ways; ways that reveal the many gaps and inconsistencies in Anne's own account, and the differences between the <i>"spyrit"</i> as Anne describes it in writing, and the reactive and live <i>"spyrit"</i> in simulation.

      <p>The <i>Housekeeping</i> will be available for free download from this website for anybody to read. However, the installation itself will only initially be accessible to my examiners. I am hoping to make it available to the general public in some form after my assessment, and to involve interested individuals in the testing and development of the project.

      <p>I'm <a href="http://bonfiredog.co.uk">Rob Sherman</a>, an interdisciplinary writer, musician and digital artist. Before I started this PhD, I had served as <a href="http://www.creativeworkslondon.org.uk/entrepreneur_scheme/rob-sherman-and-the-british-library/">Writer-In-Residence at the British Library</a>,
        worked with charities on <a href="https://bonfiredog.itch.io/the-spare-set">interactive fictions</a> and children's stories, and published a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/aug/19/random-house-black-crown-game">very large multimedia narrative</a> with Penguin Random House.</p>

      <p>The project consists of a <strong>contextual thesis</strong> and a <strong>multimedia artwork</strong> installed at Bath Spa University (<span class="visitlink">which you can visit yourself</span>). It is in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/liberal-arts/research/creative-writing-centre/">Creative (Digital) Writing department</a> at <a href="http://bathspa.ac.uk">Bath Spa University</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/comp-sci/research/human-computer-interaction/">Computer Science department</a> at <a href="http://bath.ac.uk">Bath University</a>. It is due to be completed in October 2018. My supervisors are the incomparable <a href="http://www.katepullinger.com/">Professor Kate Pullinger</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/Leon/index.shtml#Top">Dr. Leon Watts</a>.

      <span id="frontpagepara1">
      <p>The artwork at the heart of Project <span class="knole">knole</span> consists of both a text artifact and a live installation to be housed in the cool, flagstoned basement of <a href="http://www.corsham-court.co.uk/">Corsham Court</a>, a late Tudor manor deep in the Wiltshire countryside which serves as Bath Spa University's postgraduate campus.</p>
      </span>

      <div id="headerline3"><img src="img/meta/line.png" /></div>
      <p>While the text, the <i>Housekeeping</i> of the <span id= "artlink">cunning woman Anne Latch</span>, will be accessible to anybody, and I believe has artistic worth when read on its own, attendance at the installation will be by prior registration only, both before and after my examination. I am also interested in involving members of the public over the course of the project's development, hosting test versions, focus groups and discussions in different locations across the South West of England.

      <p>If you are interested in being involved in the project, whether visiting the installation, providing feedback on the <a href="https://github.com/bonfiredog/knole">publicly-accessible drafts</a> or merely keeping up to date with its progress, please register using the form below. This will subscribe you to a mailing list which will only be used to contact you with updates on the project, provide you with download links for the <i>Housekeeping</i> and give details of arranging a visit to the installation. You can unsubscribe from the list at any time, and if you have any questions about the project, your attendance or anything else you can contact me by <a href="mailto:robert.sherman15@bathspa.ac.uk">email</a>, or on <a href="http://twitter.com/rob_sherman">Twitter</a>.</p>
