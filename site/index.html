      <span id="frontpagepara1"><p>As a <strong>practice-based PhD</strong>, Project <span class="knole">knole</span> seeks to embody my research topics,
        and generate new knowledge, through a work of art, and a narrative told: a narrative that begins with the rather startling claims printed above.</p></span>

      <div id="headerline3"><img src="https://robsherman.co.uk/knole/img/meta/line.png" /></div>

      <p>Above is a facsimile of the opening page of a pamphlet printed by <strong>William Cryer</strong> in the city of Sheffield, England, in the closing months of the year 1760.
        Commonly known as 'chapbooks' or 'chaps', these documents were part of a rich literary culture that spread
        news, ephemeral rumour and popular myth across many classes and demographics. <strong>Anne Latch</strong>, the author of this
        particular pamphlet,
        never wanted the notoriety or scrutiny that such wide and rapid distribution would bring her.</p>

  <a href="dl/projectknole_hk_final.pdf"><div class="dl_link">Download The Pamphlet</div></a>

<p>She sent her work to Cryer, written on scraps of accounts paper in
        a barely-legible scrawl, on the strength of his reputation as a <i>"lofer of Troth"</i>, and in apparent trust of his discretion.
         The pair had never met, and never would: Anne was
        leaving the county, and did not plan to wait to see the fruits of any publicity. Enclosing a hefty fee, Anne gave strict instructions that only one copy of her words, unexpurgated and untampered,
        was to be printed: and that Cryer was then to deliver the resulting, unique work to its one rightful recipient, a young woman who lived in the city as a member of a well-to-do family, and was already a <i>"subscryber"</i> to Cryer's other monthly periodicals and chapbooks.</p><p>
        Anne gave no address for this woman, and no name, and only the barest of physical descriptions. She did not know her: only that this woman had appeared to her in
        a dream, repeatedly; and as a woman who rarely dreamed anything at all, Anne knew that this was the sign that she had been waiting for.</p> <p>The pamphlet was to serve many purposes when it reached this mysterious recipient. It was a legal deed,
       gifting to her all of Anne's worldly goods. It was a defense of Anne's character, a defiant prescription of her innocence in the face of all that of which she was accused. Perhaps most plainly, it was a set of simple instructions detailing how, in
       assuming Anne's mantle, that young woman was to carry on her work.</p>

        <p>William Cryer despaired of ever finding this woman in a city of thousands of young, bored dilletantes looking more for <i>"novele"</i> adventure than this over-long doggerel by an ill-educated moorswoman. Understandably <a href="#publishermark">thinking of his bottom line</a>, he printed hundreds of copies of
            Anne's words, sensationalising them, tampering with them to an unknowable degree; latterly, he sold them wherever he could. They made him, briefly, a very rich man, reversing his declining fortunes. As far as is known, Anne never confronted him
         about his betrayal. She left the county the week after, by the new toll road, and was never seen again.</p>

      <p>On the face of it, Anne's bequeathment was no great prize, for its 'rightful' owner or for any of Mr. Cryer's other customers who came to claim it. She was not a rich woman,
        owning only her father's dilapidated
        cottage in the hamlet of <strong>Nighthead</strong>, high up on the dun, misty gritstone moors above Sheffield's western edge. Nighthead was
         a lonely place, without much character; consisting of a few waterlogged fields, a sneeze of ever-wet houses and the dwarfish, gnarled church which served
          them. Its only real landmark was the River Night, which rose in a wood just north of the hamlet and spread through the sod beneath the houses in a thousand
          invisible rills. Some ten years earlier, an enormous cotton mill had been built downstream, harnessing the river's energy as it dropped from scarp to scarp to
           power some of the earliest and most primitive machinery of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. The mill was owned by the powerful
            Knole family, and employed almost the entire population of Nighthead; until two years earlier, Anne counted amongst them.</p>

       <div class="textimg">
         <img src="https://robsherman.co.uk/knole/img/moor.JPG" alt="a picture of the moor"/>
         <span class="caption">The Wyming Edge, on the Sheffield Moors close to the former site of Nighthead.</span>
         </div>

      <p>The house itself was, arguably, the least appealing in a settlement of unappealing homes. It came with a half-acre of land, but was built on a pavement of
        well-drained limestone, and not even weeds would grow against it. Its thick walls held in the damp and the darkness, and in the kitchen a <strong>huge crack</strong> in the yellowing daub
        had grown as high as man's thigh, and wide enough to peer inside.</p>

       <div class="textimg">
         <img src="https://robsherman.co.uk/knole/img/knolemill.png" alt="a picture of the mill"/>
         <span class="caption">A woodcut of the Knole mill, produced the year before its destruction by fire in 1760.</span>
         </div>

         <p>It was this crack, however, and what Anne had found inside it, which came to form the centre of her smallish, bracken-bound world: which led
           to her rise, and eventual fall. Almost everybody who came across her pamphlet would have heard of <strong><i>'The Wyfe of Nighthead'</i></strong>, even if they had never
           been to the village to visit with her. In part, the pamphlet was an account of the events that led to her infamy, a way for Anne to break from her own reputation and speak directly
           to somebody - in particular, another woman - who she thought would understand, and <i>"subscrybe"</i> to her version of events.</p>

           <p>It was in this crack two years previously, when it was barely larger than a mousehole, that Anne had first seen what
             she could only ever describe as <strong><i>"the Beest"</i></strong>: a creature that had arrived, silently and without a whiff of brimstone, and made its lair in the
             walls of her house. It didn't look like any of the species of creature that survived on the overworked, overhunted moorland. It had horns like a cow,
             or the Devil, but they were as blunt and as rounded as a child's milk teeth. Its body, receding into the darkness of the cavity, was as cylindrical
             as a serpent's, but furred with thick bands of greasy hair. Its eyes glowed pupil-less, but there was something in them that she seemed to recognise;
             something not quite human, but certainly not quite animal either. It did not come into her home uninvited, or steal her soul or speak to her in Latin. Instead
             it waited, and watched, on the threshold, as expectant and compliant as the new mechanical <i>"stations"</i>
             that clattered day and night, almost unsupervised, in Mr. Knole's mill.</p>

           <p>Demons and fairies had been fairly regular features of country life, even in Anne's father's time; and there had always been men and women
              who had made
             <strong><i>"compacks"</i></strong> with them and received their aid in tending to the needs, concerns and desires of a populace eager for convenient solutions
             to the problems
             which the world impressed upon them every day: potions to heal the sick, fortunes for the unlucky and curses for the criminal. Some were witches,
             though
              nobody alive in Nighthead could remember seeing one of these pitiful creatures in their lifetimes. Others were healers, soothsayers or cunning-folk: <i>soilwarps</i>
              in the local dialect. Despite her natural scepticism - and her self-image as a <i>"moderne"</i> woman - the easy, almost mechanistic  manners of the creature
              in its crack, its auspicious appearance
              and its willingness to be manipulated and exhorted, led Anne naturally to establish herself as one of these community psychopomps, with
              the <i>"Beest"</i> as her familiar. Using its body as a garden of ingredients, and its
              mysterious behaviours as signs pregnant with confirmations of her powers, she developed a series of rituals, spells and <i>"receipts"</i> designed to assuage the fears, heal the wounds
              and bless the enterprises of her neighbours. Her fame spread, and soon she could count gentleman farmers, judges and even the new <i>"Doctors"</i> of the Enlightenment amongst her clientele.

         <span class="caption">A stylised woodcut of Anne's 'spyrit', commissioned by her publisher William Cryer.</span>
         </div>

         <p>To the delight of Cryer's reading public, always hungry for a narrative of scandal, Anne's ascent was sharply curtailed by rumours of attempted
           murder, witchcraft and the question of the nature of her relationship with this serpentine, captivating being. In choosing to flee her
           plummeting reputation,
           however, Anne was not ready to let her work, and her new social relevance, disappear. Above all else, her pamphlet formed a <strong>set of instructions</strong> to the young
           woman who Anne wished to replace her. It was a series of recipes that would teach the girl exactly how to <strong>manipulate and operate</strong> this obedient creature; to turn out miracles as easily as the nearby mill turned out bolts of cloth. It was a new, and very different, sort of Housekeeping, and a modern <i>"wifry"</i>; a female breed of magic that did not require social standing, masculine authority or a departure from the indoor realm at all.</p>

           <p>Anne's <strong><i>Housekeeping</i></strong>, as it came to be called, makes up one half of Project
          <span class="knole">knole</span>. It serves as the guide and context to the other half: an <strong>installation</strong> piece which sparsely recreates Anne's kitchen, its growing crack and the creature that lived inside it, built as a <strong>computer simulation using mixed reality technologies and well-established artificial intelligence techniques</strong>. You can download the <i>Housekeeping</i> below; and as a <i>"subscryber"</i> to its narrative, you have as much right as any other to claim Anne's bequeathment; to visit this version of her home, and of her
           psychological universe; to sit cross-legged before the crack and use her instructions to <i>"come to know"</i>
           the creature as an individual, as a tool, and as a symbol for the competing and conflicting sensibilities of Anne's era and our own.

      <ul>
        <li>In late 2016, I was interviewed about Project <span class="knole">knole</span> in an interview with <a href="http://bbc.in/2aYpNSy">BBC Radio Derby</a>.</li>
        <li>I was part of the organising committee for Bath Spa's <a href="http://esrc17.weebly.com">Early Stage Researcher</a> Conference in June 2017. As well as running workshops on computational storytelling, I developed the conference's website, organised volunteers and helped technicians with the digital preservation of session recordings.</li>
        <li>I am an occasional member of the Bath Spa Empathy Research Group.</li>
        <li>Project <span class="knole">knole</span> was one of the case studies for a project by the <a href="http://blogs.bl.uk/digital-scholarship/2016/09/digital-conversation-british-library-ethos-multimedia-phd-theses.html">British Library's EThOS database</a> researching multi-modal or non-text theses by British postgraduate candidates.</li>
        <li>I was awarded <a href="http://www.thebothyproject.org/residencies/supported-programme/rob-sherman-supported-residency/">an artistic residency</a> with the Bothy Project, a Scottish arts charity with access to remote, off-grid cabins throughout Scotland. You can <a href="http://www.thebothyproject.org/rob-sherman/">read my photo-essay</a> on my time in Inshriach in the Highlands, and how isolation in the natural world can change our imaginative processes.</li>
        <li> I am kindly sponsored by <a href="https://iiyama.com/gb_en/">Iiyama</a>, a Japanese manufacturer of extremely well-made computer monitors. They kindly gave me one of their
        <a href="https://iiyama.com/gl_en/products/prolite-tf2738msc-b1/">ProLite TF2738MSC-B1</a> touchscreen monitors to use in the installation, and it's a rare (and very heavy) beauty.</li>
        <li> I remain an occasional member of the <a href="https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/schools/liberal-arts/research/empathy-and-writing/">Bath Spa Empathy Research Group</a>.</li>
        <li> My project is in collaboration with the <a href="http://museumofwitchcraftandmagic.co.uk/">Museum of Witchcraft and Magic</a>, which has been resident in the Stygian, Albionic village of Boscastle in Cornwall since 1960. As well as providing unparalleled research facilities, it hosted a pilot
        version of the <code>knole</code> installation from <a href="http://museumofwitchcraftandmagic.co.uk/event/meet-the-spyrit-familiar-of-an-18th-century-cunning-woman/">July 3rd - July 5th 2018</a>.</li>
        <li>The project was featured in a documentary video (by <a href="http://www.torchydesign.co.uk/">Torchy Design</a>) for <a href="https://www.indycube.community/">Indycube Swansea</a>:

      <h5 id="theorysubtitle">(The Academic Theory Of Project <span class="knole">knole</span>)</h5>



    <div id="theoryquestion"><strong>Primary Research Question:</strong> <em>“How might a character in computational art maintain their defining quality of dynamic agency within a system, while achieving the 'resonant' qualities of characters in more static art-forms?”</em>

    <span id="frontpagepara1">
  <p>While this website doesn’t take great pains to demonstrate it, Project <span class="knole">knole</span> is a <strong>work of narrative fiction</strong>. Anne, her <i>“Beest”</i>, William Cryer, and even the village of Nighthead itself are what literary theorists call <i>“non-actual”</i>, what historical scholars would call <i>“counterfactual”</i>, and what everybody else would consider <strong>fictional</strong>. Despite their vividness in our individual minds and collective culture, these beings are literally <i>without actuality</i>: not real people in the material world, but people in a possible world of the imagination, <strong>characters</strong> whom we can materially perceive only through the partial viewports that their authors provide to us.</p>

    </span>

    <p>Like any fiction, <span class="knole">knole</span> concerns itself with the narratives of its possible world: the sequences of events and non-events created by the decisions and indecisions, the agonies and ecstasies, of the <strong>illusory beings</strong> who inhabit it. In its own minor way, it continues the mission of all storytelling, whether realised in film, theatre, populist chapbooks or the <i>“novele”</i> works that were becoming popular amongst some of Anne’s wealthier clients: a mission to understand, through other beings, <strong>what it is to be a being ourselves</strong>, in our own lives.</p>

  <p>The Project is not, however, only an attempt to tell a good story. As a practice-based PhD, it also must stand as a piece of <strong>theory</strong>: it is not just a work concerning characters, but also concerning <strong>the very nature of character itself</strong>. Above all, it presents as a <strong>new methodology</strong> for artists trying to tell such stories, and create such beings, using one of the most exciting and rapidly-evolving technologies available to them: <strong>the computer</strong>. While computational technology is well-rooted in many existing artistic traditions dating back centuries (if not, ultimately, millennia), it has several <i>“particular”</i> qualities of its own which set it apart from older narrative forms, and more traditional ways of constructing character. A computer, as a machine with which we can interact, has the potential to create a <strong>systemic</strong>, <strong>procedural</strong> functioning simulation of some aspect of fictional worlds. Characters is such works of narrative <strong>computational art</strong> – whether it be a videogame, a work of virtual heritage, a digital installation or a piece of robotics – are a representation of a being that functions in some of the ways that we expect such beings to function – that have some of the dynamic features of agency, emotional life, mental faculty or social presence, rather than just constituting a static description of those things. Such a character has the potential to represent something meaningful, something <strong>resonant</strong>, about <i>being a being</i> in a manner particular to the computational.</p>

  </div>

 <p>As in Anne’s lifetime, when some of the most atavistic, well-worn narratives and characters of everyday English life – from the stories of the Church to the superstitions of popular belief – were being challenged and renegotiated, the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have been confronted with fundamental questions about the nature of <i>being</i>, self-expression and technology. It is a phenomenally exciting time to be working as an artist. However, even if you are not a scholar or an aficionado of digital art, you will probably have some inkling that realising this potential of computer characterisation has proved <strong>a far trickier prospect</strong> than initially realised. </p>

    </div>

<p>There are <strong>fundamental differences</strong> between the manner in which computers and beings function, and these remain difficult to reconcile artistically. Many of the dreams of the artificial intelligence movement to produce <i>“synthetic persons”</i> have proved hubristic at best, and in the videogames industry - perhaps the most prolific producer of computational narrative – characters range from <strong>shallow, mechanistic automata</strong>, little different from the clattering and compliant machinery at the Nighthead mill, to representations so barely computational that they are <strong>indistinguishable from the characters which they emulate</strong> in books and film. Very few seem to find the <strong>critical balance</strong> required to meet this potential of the form. At its heart, as in every artform, this remains a balance between the work and the reception of that work: between the expressive, encoded systems and media that form the initial, and relatively-bare, workings of character authored <i>in the form</i>, and the completed character, the <i>full being</i> in their possible world, as they are perceived in the audience’s <strong>imagination</strong>.</p>

</div>

<p>Much of the most prominent discourse today in aesthetic theory, including within the digital arts, is what is called <strong>audience-responsive</strong>: it privileges the role of the audience’s imagination, their personalities, their circumstances and even their bodies as integral parts of the artwork. Audiences do not merely receive the hermetically-sealed wisdom of the artist as an artefact to worship. By comprehending the relatively-sparse representation of character which the artwork presents, and then understanding and extrapolating those representations in their minds, the audience has <strong>a distinct hand in constructing these beings themselves</strong>. It is increasingly agreed in the literature that this extrapolative imagination arises from evolved structures in the brain, and cultural processes in our society that <strong>pre-date the modern concept of the aesthetic</strong>; structures that we have used for millions of years to understand the world around us, and its inhabitants, by ascribing narrative meaning to them. Despite this, artistic theory still seems reluctant to let go of the idea that our experience of aesthetic narratives, and fictional characters in art, are <strong>rarefied</strong> in some way: what is often called <i>“aesthetic illusion”</i>. When we respond to a work of art – when we empathise with the characters, observe their travails within our minds' eyes, it is commonly thought that we do so within a <i>“magic circle”</i>, a neutral demesnes of lets-pretend where we can engage with the emotions and experiences that they evoke – our understanding of <i>being a being</i> – safely. Our firm and constant <i>“distance”</i> from these imaginative experiences sets them apart formally from other imaginings in our lives from which, seemingly, we have no distance: religious belief, delusions, and the social experiences of everyday existence.</p>

<p>Project <span class="knole">knole</span>, in attempting to solve the problems of computational character – to find that crucial equilibrium between the work I make and the reception it receives in my audience's mind – begins by <strong>reframing this narrow concept of the imagination</strong>, drawing on a growing body of interdisciplinary research between the sciences and arts. This research demonstrates that, on neurobiological and conceptual levels alike, our imaginative responses to art (and in particular fictional characters) are not so different from those in the rest of our lives, including our responses to the people around us, tangible experiences in the real world, or deeply-held religious beliefs and superstitions. Our supposed <i>“distance”</i> from the great characters of fiction is deeply questionable, and likewise the concept of <i>“belief”</i> in religion is more complex than it first appears. Instead, such experiences seem to be part of the same promiscuous spectrum of mental/physical experience, drawn from a common and ancient set of human phenomena. While I certainly don’t want the responsibility (or, frankly, the reading list) for formalising such a spectrum, in my work I tentatively call it the <strong>autocosmic</strong>, steering clear entirely of the far more freighted <i>imagination</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>This idea of a network of <strong>‘self-worlds’</strong> that abut and intertangle within the human mind, inhabited by beings both actual and non-actual, provides the computational artist with an avenue out of their predicament. The cultures of computational art currently <strong>rely heavily on models of narrative from other types of art</strong>, whether the Hollywood blockbuster or the realist novel: an unsurprising result when the idea of <i>“aesthetic illusion”</i> both unifies and balkanises all aesthetic endeavour from the rest of human life. The <strong>autocosmic</strong> breaks computational art’s dependency on other artforms which limit the debate, and the vision, for what a computational being might look like, and how they might be built and experienced. Instead, happily promiscuous, an artist can range outside and away from traditional artforms and instead look for models within other <i>‘self-worlds’</i>, other arenas of human experience where we imaginatively and materially engage with personified, functioning systems rather than merely observe their doings on the page or the screen.</p>

</div>

<p>Project <span class="knole">knole</span> represents only one specific approach to this general philosophy of design and authorship. In particular, it is interested in how human engagement with landscape, place and environment – from the earliest shamanic rituals, Roman <i>genius loci</i> and the nascent Romanticism of the 18th century upper classes, to the herbal grimoire and modern nature writing – have framed places as characters, persons and beings in and of themselves: as agents with whom we socialise, and to whom we alternatively kowtow and disrespect, through both religious ceremony and secular fascination. In particular, the Project relates this to the prevalence of immersive virtual spaces within computational art; <strong>spaces often imbued with more character and resonance than the beings that are supposed to inhabit them</strong>. By trying to combine these ideas autocosmically, Project <span class="knole">knole</span> arrives at the concept of <strong>character-as-environment</strong>, and implements it through Anne's <i>"Beest"</i>: a computational character who, like the witch-haunted moorland which surrounds the village of Nighthead, is both an environment to explore and a being to meet.</p>
