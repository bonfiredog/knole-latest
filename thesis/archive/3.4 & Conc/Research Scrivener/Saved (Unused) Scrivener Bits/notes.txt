"Intentional systems" are texts to be read.
"systems are designed to encourage users to make sense of them as intentional and independent
entities"
They are "important forms of cultural production", not just technology.
"system intentionality as a
result of a hermeneutic communication process that involves both authors’ narrations and users’
interpretations through interaction with both actual systems and authors’ written and verbal output."
Cybernetics in chapter 2.
