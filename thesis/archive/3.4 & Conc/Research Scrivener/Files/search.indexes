Huckleberry Finn - “though it was so long ago.”
Hannah Kent - Burial Rites - “believable”

Bad Characters As Well?
All hated “A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing”
Hated George Eliot and Thomas Hardy characters - “could have throttled them” - “downtrodden acceptance of everything”. Either dislike as people or unbelievable. “Drive me bonkers”
“Tenuous” used a lot - means thin.



As you can see, I have included animals and inanimate objects, even celestial bodies. Others have included animals, deities. Not just humans. These can be ‘persons’ as well, though I cannot deny that this has a strong anthropomorphising connection. (Don’t really want to talk about this here; talk about it in Chapter 3).

            <Title>Brief Definitions</Title>
            <Text>
Do these definitions fit with our definitions of Anne, and Yocto?

It is outside the purview of this thesis to talk about the nature of character, but we do have to briefly say: What do we mean, or who?
Very little coherent study of characters separate from their narrative apart from in the last 15 years. (Jannidis).
“Idea of character undergoes variation in different phases of literature” (Bradbury, 2006).
Differing views of character from mere ingredient or device up to fully-fledged personhood. For some character is merely a negative space, a procedural silhouette of “effects” (Weinsheimer, 1979) in a plot or a simple “sum of binary oppositions” (Jannidis, 2013). Indeed, EM Forster (195?) calls them “word-masses”. Mine is a romantic approach, according to Bradbury (2006), “separate [characters] from surrounding fictional determinants” rather than “humanised outcroppings from some larger verbal design.”
Bradbury opposes this approach: “By definition in determined contexts” - are they really? There is definitely a move to see them outside of plot (narrative worlds rather than plot), especially in the modern world. Support for this comes from the legal profession. David Feldman (1981) (from a legal perspective) “increasingly, the commercial and popular appeal of fictional characters far surpasses the character’s role within the original work” or “created outside the context of any specific work”. He argues that the work should not reign supreme. Characters are not just “components of the works in which they appear”  Move up to transmedia and media theory today. (Needs expansion, possibly in chapter 2).
Hepola defines fictional realism for us. “Fictional realism is the claim that fictional characters—things like Antigone, Hamlet, Shere Khan, the city of Minas Tirath, and the like—actually do exist. According to a fictional realist, fictional characters are full-fledged, metaphysically respectable entities. Ophelia and Minas Tirath are as existent and as much a part of the real world as Kierkegaard and Copenhagen are.” 
Following on from Hepola’s point - we often see them as abstract entities but entities nonetheless (”Meinongian non-existents, as Platonic types, or as abstract artifacts”). Outside the realm of this essay, and my interests, to define the ‘reality’ of fictional characters (Though I will be assuming a form of reality later?), but we can state that they have some form of discursive reality, even if it is not objective. There exist concepts which are formed by concrete or mental material which we can speak around and about. Hepola splits this into attributes simpliciter and attributes “according to the story”, but obviously there are many more categories of attribute (headcanon, fan fiction, personal intrepretation etc.) 
I, obviously, side with those who see characters as interrogable separately, though would I go as far as to say that they are distinct people beyond their plots? Yes, I think I would, though we often choose to judge them in light of those plots, if not always (fan fiction, head canon etc.). I don’t want to spend too much time on this, because the nature of character is not really my main feature. I just want to be able to talk about characters as some form of constructed individual, not only to query them individually and personally, but also to query their construction.
Beings and individuals (persons), not people or humans.
“One likes to think that there is some fantastic limbo for the children of imagination, some strange, impossible place where the beaux of Fielding may still make love to the belles of Richardson, where Scott’s heroes still may strut, Dickens’s delightful Cockneys still raise a laugh, and Thackeray’s worldlings continue to carry on their reprehensible careers. Perhaps in some humble corner of such a Valhalla, Sherlock and his Watson may for a time find a place, while some more astute sleuth with some even less astute comrade may fill the stage which they have vacated.”  Arthur Conan Doyle

Partiality seems important as well; a function of perspective. As Laurel (1987) says, “characters, not people”; characters cannot attempt to be complete 1:1 simulations of real beings. Weizenbaum (1971) says that “humans… are vastly general-purpose machines”, but characters are designed for a purpose. Same with real people we meet! A person we encounter “can never supply enough details to provide me with something resembling a complete picture of his life… our personal histories are infinitely complex and ultimately unfathomable.”  And Chris Crawford “dramatic characters behave differently from real people.”

Concrete Definitions
“Figures” - Iotis Jannidis
“Word-masses” - EM Forster
An “element” (Norton, Norton and McClure, 2003) 
“Fictional personalities… one of the four main aspects of a fictional work.” (Cunnington, 2015)
“Bundles of traits, predispositions and choices that… form coherent entities” (Laurel 2013)
“Counterfeit… aspects of the human.” (McCorduck, 1979)
“Illusions” (Murray, 1997)
“Phantasms” (Plato)
“Imaginary people… nonexistents” (Walton, 1997)
“The fictional representation of a person” (Bradbury, 2006). (A ‘person’ is different from ‘human’, as we will come to look at later).

            <Title>The Quality Of Character &amp; 'Resonance'</Title>
            <Text>REFER TO ANNE AND YOCTO THROUGHOUT, AS CHARACTERS WITH QUALITIES, INTERROGABLE, DEFINABLE. WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT THEM? WE CAN’T ANSWER THIS HERE, OBVIOUSLY. BUT HERE ARE SOME WAYS TO TALK ABOUT QUALITY. OTHER EXAMPLES.
Both artists and audiences are very concerned with the ‘quality’ of character, both as a marker of ‘quality’ of its particular fictive form and as interrogable in their own right. (Recent examples of this).
Mercer (2006) - “When we engage critically with a literary work, we are not merely describing it, making it accessible to other readers; at the same time we judge it, explicitly or by implication”.
As in the Observer - “whether it’s Oliver Twist or Harry Potter, Hester Prynne or Katniss Everdeen, literary characters offer us a chance to vicariously experience life in all its drama, humor, mystery, and adventure.” 
We “come to know” characters.
(Murray) - &quot;as Forster pointed out... we are more interested in characters who are capable of surprising us than in those who are flat and predictable.&quot;
When we like a text, we “want… to make it part of our world” (Altieri)
““Great” books are, in part, considered to be great because of their cognitive value... some literature, despite being fictional, can teach readers important things about the real world” (Hepola). This is the theory of literary cognitivism. This is not necessarily her view, she is talking abstractly about literary cognitivists - does not admit to being one.
“Absorptive power” of fictional narratives.
“Sometimes a novel can affect a person’s whole identity” (Oatley)
“We would no sooner read a novel that did not move us, than an empirical articles that did not offer a validly drawn conclusion.” (Oatley)
We talk about the “impact” of narrative (Narrative Impact book)
We are “interested in the fate”  of characters (Nomura and Akai, 2012).
There are many different qualities, often pointing to different aspects of the character and its portrayal, but what about the character as a whole? What about non-specifics? (Academic context for this, or save until next section?)

The Book Group

Shadowing a book group, hear about how readers (as opposed to academics) think about characters who they have just read.

They praised character’s ‘believability’, and the author for ‘painting a picture’ (two people said this separately).
“when we discuss a novel, we must discuss its characters”

Kafka is over-descriptive, in their view; no space for the self.
They cursed some minor characters as ‘clunky devices’, others as ‘well-drawn’. They could ‘relate’ to certain characters, were “keen on” others. Some were “plausible”, others were “vivid”, even if they were “minor”. “Some where just devices that were brought in to serve a purpose and then leave”
These people, like millions of others across the world, were engaged in critical judgements of ‘quality’, very particularly not just of narratives, but of the characters which inhabited them.
The appearance of Colonel Sanders in Kafka - “unbelievable” - he “trivialised it”

￼
(My own brainstorm of qualities of characters. I am not using the term ‘literary’ anymore, as it is loaded and media-specific. These qualities (or are they techniques?) augment those below).


Words Often Used To Denote This ‘Quality’

“evocative” (Turkle, 2007);
well-written;
“sympathetic” (Oatley, 1995);
vivid;
“realistic” (Gard, 2000);
human;
“rich” (Nicolopoulou &amp; Richner, 2007);
well-shot;
“engaging” (Heidbrink, 2014);
skillfully-drawn;
“fully imagined” (Murray, 1999);
unforgettable;
“enduring” (Murran, 2016);
immortal;
“Life-like” rather than alive;
Thomas &amp; Johnson 1981 - believable characters provide an “illusion of life”
“robust” (Wawro, 2016);
evocative.

These seem to evince my previous theory of assaying characters as constructed individuals, rather than mere devices. 

A criticism of this approach is that there are many different aspects to a quality character, which differs depending on their medium and context. However, I feel that we can look generally at character, as despite differences in media, authorship and context they are broadly attempting to do different things. This links into audience reception theory and the like. They are all trying to produce an effect and affect; while the nature of these may differ, the objective remains broadly the same. I will, of course, be looking at some of these objectives more than others; which ‘resonant’ approaches I personallly find satisfying and suitable. I may need some textual backup for this idea.

Resonance

We can sum all of these up as ‘resonance’?
I define 'resonance' as those qualities of any character, in any artform, which stimulate, engage and permit interaction with the imaginative capacity of the audience. 
That which interests them, holds their attention (attention will become more important later).
I am addressing that part of characterisation that speaks to the audience.
A brief foray into the drum metaphor?
As with the book group, they painted the picture, not the author!
Based on our imagination, our senses, our remembered and current experiences.
Partiality allows resonance

            <Title>Audience, Imagination &amp; Autocosmics</Title>
            <Text>- Seguing into the centrality of audience very quickly.
- All of these terms rely on something that lies materially outside the ‘character’ as we think of it (a product of the author, publicly available in a form). It requires the vivifying input of a reader.
- In essence, the ‘reader’ of an artwork, what might be more generally called its ‘audience’, is the heart of ‘quality’. This is the focus of these metrics, and we must look at what it is about the audience, what their input is, that provides this quality. This will help us to generate it in our own work.
- Resonance comes from autocosmics - imagine and augment is in the artwork. Combination of artistic skill, the abilities and humanity of the audience. A component of reader-response theory.

[Two Irreverent Approaches To Character As Audience Simulation]

￼      
[Put this in section one?] (too irreverent?)

 ￼
[put this at the start of section two?]

COMING IN FROM AUDIENCE AS A JUDGE OF CHARACTER, AS RESONANCE BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ———&gt;
Not a new idea: well-established in the arts (many different approaches); not only that readers are ultimate judges of an artwork and its characters, but that they are part of the authoring of meaning of those artworks and characters, which relies on the reader’s subjectivity.
Reader’s Subjectivity
Gerald Prince’s Reader - “Decoder, decipherer, interpreter of… any text.” (Text in the general sense) “stressing not only the constraints imposed by the text, but also the ways in which the readers’ nature, interests, and goals partly determine the assumptions they make about texts, the questions they ask of them, the answers they formulate—and he also discussed how (narrative) texts partly read themselves, as it were, by commenting explicitly on some of their constituents”.
Texts are not just passively accepted, but actively interpreted. 
“the person’s subjectivity is important” - Laurel
“A personally imaginative result” - “not just experience but creation” - Oatley again in Narrative Impact.
Wolf also says that the recipient and their context must be taken into account (a “plurality of such contexts must always be assumed”, as well as the representation itself: they are ‘directors’ or ‘producers’ of the ‘script’ of the material representation.
“an active figure rather than a mere affective target for experience or instruction.” (Childs &amp; Fowler)
“the reader or member of the theatre audience must become an integrating centre of different streams of information”.
“We are primarily responsible for the creation of meaning when reading a literary text… represents the greatest expression of the reader’s contribution to the imagining of the world of the text”.
“In the act of reading, a text becomes a living subject within the reader.”
Maybe, then, characters are in part the sum of binary oppositions - they must be defined in opposition to their audience!
We see the importance of a character’s partiality, mentioned earlier: “Fragmentary nature of information provided in fiction.. Filling in gaps in our knowledge with hunches, ideas, feelings, or impressions” 

This Is READER RESPONSE THEORY
We have dealt with these two before, haven’t we?
Focus on the audience goes all the way back to the Greeks (Prince) Arose again, amongst literary circles, in the early 1920s (from the work of IA Richards and CS Lewis’ ‘An Experiment in Criticism’, (really into the 60s and 70s)partly as a reaction to the strength of New Criticism in America and Formalism in Russia, which was itself a reaction to a 19th century socio-political focus on author biography, demography and historical context. These formalist positions, in the view of scholars such as Erlich, separated a literature’s meaning from the psychology, sociology and intellectual history of the reader and author, making them “secondary to and dependent on purely verbal, linguistic facts.”  “Jakobson makes it clear that he rejects completely any notion of emotion as the touchstone of literature”. Warner These verbal, linguistic facts could only be found in the originating artwork.
Essays such as The Intentional Fallacy and The Affective Fallacy attempted to show the follow of relying on either the author (the intention) or the reader (the affect) as purveyors or producers of meaning.
Reader-Response, then, rejected the “objectivist position” (Rosenblatt) of New Criticism, and the idea that literature was a self-contained, self-referential object, stating that the Formalists saw meaning “as something to be deconstructed into absurdity” (Murray p5). A reader ought to be considered to “[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a ‘ready-made’ product.” (Hawkes). Fish saw the Formalists as &quot;inconclusive adducing of evidence&quot; - always arguing what a thing means, cannot seal a text off - always upset by some new corrupting influence from outside. THe influence from outside is important. 
Tied to the rise of postmodern individualism, identity politics and deconstructionist power critiques by writers such as Foucault and Barthes, leading to the orientation of readers, in the mid-20th century, from “passive… objects… to role of audiences in interpretation and evaluation”, and literature into an “affiliative joining of reader and author, or reader and characters” in “a plurality of writings-and-interpretations.” (Oatley) Not just judgements of how good it is, but the very construction of a text from its signs into an internal, imaginative meaning. Since then, many different positions have arisen, and it has moved into more general  discourses across the arts: can be called Reception Theory or Audience Response Theory more generally. (cite these terms?). For example, Susan Bennett and Brenda Laurel in theatre studies (where else?) Has even branched into communications theory and cultural studies, particularly under the auspices of Stuart Hall. “Active interpretation within relevant codes.” Asserts agency of consumer in their consumption of ‘media texts’. Modern improvements in neuroscientific methods and more advanced psychological literature have led to a melding of the two.
Criticised as anarchic subjectivism or ontological relativisim

A BRIEF DIVERSION INTO THE BOOK GROUP, PLACING MY QUOTES FROM THEM IN A READER-RESPONSE CONTEXT. JUDGING CHARACTERS, DIVULGING MEANING FROM THEIR ACTIONS, RELATING TO THEIR OWN LIVES AND EXPERIENCES, THEIR READING HISTORY (THE CULTURE), PRODUCING AND ADAPTING THEIR OWN STORIES IMAGINING MORE THAN WAS EXPLICITLY STATED. DISCUSSING CHARACTERS AS A FORM OF PLAY, REBUILDING THE WORLD. 

Relates to other, recent, reader-response work on book groups. Long found that reading groups described their discussions as 'playful', that is, creative: “they actively constructed meanings together, sometimes in joint streams-of-consciousness, based on such issues as character, identifications, and the moral qualities of the books as they related to the members' own lives” (Oatley).

Oatley also worked on reading groups: sees it as a “meeting of minds” between “reader with a book, or reader with an author.” Can be “profound.”

Says that reading groups is a way to break out of hegemony and assert importance of the reader away from cultural authority. (ref. Hall’s work).

REVIEW OF READER-RESPONSE APPROACHES 
Many different approaches, some of which are more relevant to resonance, and character, than others, as well as for the author of a creative work who wishes to use this approach to inform their practice. This is the HOW. All important for looking at character.
The Ways In Which Readers Can Respond
Cohen - Identification: “Identification is an imaginative experience in which a person surrenders consciousness of his or her own identity and experiences the world through someone else’s point of view”.
An audience member may respond by liking or disliking characters, feeling close to them (affinity; Newton &amp; Buck 1985; Newton,Buck,&amp;Woelfel,1986), finding similarities or differences between the characters and themselves (similarity; Reeves &amp; Miller, 1978), finding the characters sexually or romantically attractive (attachment; Steever, 1994), developing PSI with them (Horton &amp; Wohl,1956), or desiring to imitate them (imitation; Hoffner,1996).
The Splitting Of Narratives Into Codes Or Processes
(Prince) Reader’s ‘proairetic code’ (action sequence), ‘hermeneutic code’ (plot sequence) ‘referential’ code (context) ‘semic code’ (characters and settings (relate to my work!)) ‘symbolic code’ (meaning production and reception)
Narrative Transmission (Prince) - Real Author -&gt; Implied Author -&gt; Narrator -&gt; Narratee -&gt; Implied Reader -&gt; Real Reader
Barthes’ ‘codes for reading’ in looking at Balzac’s ‘Sarrasine’
The Persona Of The Reader
Schonert’s ‘Ideal Reader’ (the platonic reader understanding everything), Riffaterre’s ‘Superreader’ (a combination of all the text’s readers), Gibson’s ‘Mock Reader’ (1950) (a figure implied by text, a part which real readers are asked to play), Iser’s ‘Implied Reader’ (the reader “called for” by a text’s “structure of appeal” . These all rely on the reader having  “existed at least over the past few centuries of Western culture, during which the evolution of aesthetic verisimilitude and responses to illusionist art are comparatively well documented.”
Sartre said that writers write for specific readers in their time; relies on their autocosmics. For Sartre, “every concrete reader is a creator, necessary for the renewed emergence of the literary object”
Prince lists many other sorts of reader - the real reader (the flesh-and-blood person actually reading the text) and the implied reader (the equivalent of the reader’s second self or the counterpart or complement of the implied author), the ideal reader (who grasps and approves every aspect of the text), the virtual reader (for whom the real author believes s/he is writing and to whom s/he assigns various characteristics and abilities) and such interpretive notions as superreaders, informed readers, or competent readers.
Genette’s ‘narratee’ - “Narratees should be distinguished from real, implied, or other kinds of readers. The narratee is the audience (of one or more than one) that the narrator in a given narrative addresses. It is constituted and signified by textual signs of the “you” narrated to…” (Prince?)
Walton calls them ‘appreciators’.
Wolf talks about the ‘average’ recipient.
Eco’s ‘model reader’ - the text models the reader implicitly.
Wolf - It would be possible to continue with this profile of the optimal reader, but I would not get very far before someone would point out that what I am really describing is the intended reader, the reader whose education, opinions, concerns, linguistic competences, etc. make him capable of having the experience the author wished to provide. 
Importance Of The Author
As Stanley Fish says in Affective Stylistics - no text without reader (trained by them, but was a reader-response guy)  “in that its significant structures are not given but ascertained by prior interpretive procedures that are always already in place”, usually as part of “interpretative communities” rather than the authority of the reader.
Barthes “proclaimed the author’s death and the reader’s birth as the locus of textual meaning,” - no author, but audience. Barthes - “a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination” disagree with him over the idea of reader as impersonal however. (Death Of The Author)
Some Reader-Response people take a mixed view: Iser says that works have both unwritten and written parts. He distinguishes between “concretization by the reader, and the work of art resulting from their convergence”. Argues that a text guides the production of meaning, through schema, constraints and directions, while leaving gaps to be filled through the audience’s sensemaking. The aesthetic object comes out of this. (All from Childs &amp; Fowler).
Meaning is not inherent in text itself, but is created out of relationship,  a “special kind of meeting” between author and audience. - Oatley. Rommetveit - “temporarily shared social reality” between writer, text and reader, Thurgar-Dawson’s reciprocal spatial realities. “Geography, and indeed textual geography, does indeed space; it causes a new space to be formed both on the page and in the mind of the reader, it is spacially performative, not merely constative or mimetic”. 
“Writing is only half an act. The full act is writing and reading.” - Oatley
“Research does not support the claim that readers necessarily receive messages intended by authors” (Sklar, from Narvaez).
Transactional Reader-Response Theory - like videogames. Two meanings that come together 
A “bi-active” model - the text controls some of the response and the reader controls the rest. Is all reader-response generally bi-active?
A almost political, oppositional model - Eco’s ‘aberrant encoding’, Hall’s encoding/decoding model - ‘preferring’ reading, ‘dominant readings, ‘negotiated readings. ‘Oppositional’ readings. A politicised edge to reader-response theory. Assumes that dominant reading is hegemonic.  A “rhetoric of contestation” from Barthes - the reader resists the supposed meaning of a text and produces their own.


We’ve done the HOW - WHY does this happen? Why does reader-response theory make sense, to what is it pointing? What is it that the author is courting? All important for looking at character. The phenomenology of a text - how readers concretise by turning “a mere series of sentences into an aesthetic object”

Lots of terms for it (’imagination’, ‘assimilation’, ‘accommodation’, ‘absorption’ (Cohen 2001), “immersion” (Ryan 1991, Schaeffer 1999), “involvement” and “psychological participation” (Walton 1990), “transportation” (Gerrig 1993), Green, Brock, Kaufman - “transportation” ‘abstraction’ (Hugill &amp; Yang)  ) - most precise term, within a narratological context, is ‘aesthetic illusion’ (Werner Wolf) - “a basically pleasurable mental state that emerges during the reception of many representational texts, artifacts or performances…elicited by a conjunction of factors that are located (a) in the representations themselves, (b) in the reception process and the recipients, and (c) in framing contexts, e.g. cultural-historical, situational and generic ones.”  This suits us as it places the author and the reader in a relationship, working towards what we might call Iser’s “aesthetic object”.

Refers to lots of different activities that we undertake with characters in narratives, such as Kaufman and Libby’s (2012) “experience-taking”  with its “reduced sense of self-concept”, Hayakawa’s insistence that ‘reading lets you live many lives’. Kratka’s “identification” (Others?)

Wolf cites the start of aesthetic illusion in the 6th-4th centuries BC in greece - &gt; art went from magical and religious to purely aesthetic. 

“The ability to interpret is not acquired; it is constitutive of being human.” (Fish). “A writer makes his marks not to provoke a response, but because he knows a response will be provoked.” It is natural, but is induced by reading.  Individuals do not have to be taught to become immersed in stories.

&quot;visibility&quot; = &quot;imagination&quot; - he devotes an entire essay to it! &quot;The mental cinema is always at work in each one of us... [it never] stop[s] projecting images before our mind's eye.&quot; The mind’s camera is as important as a film character. &quot;In devising a story, therefore, the first thing that comes to my mind is an image that for some reason strikes me as charged with meaning&quot;

Closely related to Zwaan’s ‘situation model’ - “mental representations of the state of affairs described in a text rather than of the text itself.”

Aesthetic illusion is not restricted to narratives, as illustrated by important forms of non-narrative illusionist painting (portraits, still lives, genre scenes, landscape painting, etc.), though the 19th century realist novel produced the height of aesthetic illusion, in Wolf’s opinion (hence why so many Dickens, Flaubert etc. characters appear on ‘best character lists’). Nonetheless, “aesthetic illusion is therefore a transmedial, transmodal and transgeneric phenomenon.” 



Features Of Aesthetic Illusion
Suspension Of Disbelief (from Coleridge originally)
&quot;human propensity to suspend disbelief in the presence of a persuasive dramatic presence&quot; (Murray)
“Total delusion is rarely achieved (we do not rush on stage to whisper in the tragic hero’s ear) and would probably be psychologically damaging.” (Childs &amp; Fowler).
“Both readers and writers conspire to create often-unpredictable outcomes”
Wolf’s ‘Reception Contract’
Nell The “reading trance”
“Guided Projection” (1960) (Gombrich)
Zwaan - “Much of the research on situation models in narrative comprehension suggests that comprehenders behave as though they are in the narrated situation rather than outside of it.”
Celare artem - maintain the conceit that it is real (Wolf)
Hilgrard compared reading to hypnosis
Approaches a fictional work “with the intention of inducing an (aesthetic) experience”, then when in it “simultaneously disengage his awareness of the work’s fictionality… [imbued with] the sensation of realism”
References Scheff’s scale of aesthetic distance; how strongly do we feel the artwork?
Amie Thomasson’s ‘internal’ and ‘external’ contexts for talking about characters. As real or as fictional.
Hepola taking the fictional realism perspective ““involves a certain amount of pretense.”
&quot;second-order&quot; beliefs - suspension of disbelief.
Wittig’s ‘meaning system’ - bring their own lives into it. Narvaez’s ‘schemas’
Not suspension of disbelief but the “generation of temporary belief” (Childs &amp; Fowler).
Nell (1988) studied people who read at least one book a week for pleasure. He made recordings from the autonomic nervous systems and facial muscles of these subjects as they read books of their choice. He found high physiological arousal, but subjects also reported a trance-like satisfaction.
Metaphors, similes, descriptions have us simulate those spaces and smells and experiences vividly.
Self-reinforcing: Gardner &amp; Knowles (2009) - facourite characters are anthropomorphised more. 
Strong enough that we can feel their ‘presence’. Small reference to social presence. Schubert, Friedmann, &amp; Rogenbrecht’s 2001 presence scale. parasocial relationships - shoemaker etc.
an 'illusion of intimacy' -Horton &amp; Wohl
A fiction is a mental structure (Vaihinger, Kermode etc.)

This has led to what has been called ‘the paradox of fiction’ (Colin Radford, 1975)
That is, why do we seem to feel real emotion about beings which we know do not exist in real life? Our reaction to fiction is irrational. Schneider thinks they are real emotions. Since then, “inconsistency and incoherence”. &quot;various debates... continue to rage.&quot;
Aesthetic illusion seems to be at its heart, but the qualities of the emotions that it generates has been under scrutiny for over 50 years.
Sklar’s approach - he sees the “‘real/fictional’ dichotomy” as false  - we “bring many of the same intuitions and forms of evaluation to our encounters with fictional characters that we use with real people”. Characters have an “imaginative reality”… “imagined as… real individuals with distinct realities”. Readers take experiences with fictional characters into their lives which “suggest[s] that they regard the emotions that they are feeling while reading as something more than fiction” “We respond… emotionally to fictional characters, whom we regard intuitively as real people”.
Kendall Walton, a Pretend Theorist - they are ‘quasi-emotions’ - we are consciously ‘playing’ at being emotional with the story. They are not substantially different from real emotions - what they differ in is their source. They can be real emotions, but not (responding in ‘Spelunking and Slime’.) Like child’s play. “Participation in make-believe… is itself a form of mental simulation.”  “In simulating, one’s psychological mechanisms are being run “off line… they are disconnected from some of their usual behavioural manifestations.” “Appreciators do not literally pity Willy Loman, grieve for Anna Karenina, and admire Superman.” This does not, in her view, lower the quality or importance of these emotions. Uses the metaphor of a car on a track with the screen of a mountain road behind it. Walton assumes a deliberate edge to aesthetic illusion. Kendall Walton thinks it isn’t important that we don’t really believe in what we see (unlike Sklar, who believes we do. Walton bemoans the “undue emphasis” on this point). I think she sees that “magic circle” theory is the most important. 

Hartz and Novitz both pointed out that art-lovers don't believe that they are 'pretending' emotions - they believe they are really having them. Walton says that the acceptance of the 'game' may be tacit - we do not realise that our emotions are not real.

Simo Saatela - startle effect in films - we are not pretending those. They are real, just &quot;mistaken identification&quot; - our body thinks the thing is real, at a certain level, before we consciously recognise that it is not). can't account for every emotion, however, but maybe just those very basal ones (what Hartz calls &quot;pre-conscious&quot;) such as startle, gag reflex etc. Those ones tied to body - embodied theory of mind.

We are moved by fiction - just not to real fear

Thought Theory - don't need something to exist for us to feel emotion for it. Peter Lamarque says that we only need to &quot;represent&quot; &quot;entertain in thought&quot; (carroll), R.T. Allen - &quot;truth is not confined to the factual&quot;. Not frightened by the representation, but the simulation in my mind. Radford said that we are still, then, frightened by fictional thoughts.

Turvey attacks Thought Theory in relation to film - ignores the concrete image on the screen, privileging the mental simulation. Certainly might make sense for film, (maybe return to it in section 2?)

Therefore fiction fits the aesthetic illusion idea best because it is entirely symbolic, rather than pictoral? Need to address this. Turvey moves towards a hybridity - that there may be intermediate stages where we can &quot;entertain&quot; the concrete image within us without converting it into a fully-blown simulation. 

Thought Theory can't explain WHY mere thoughts move us.

Counterpart Theory - the real emotions we feel when we read fiction is because we are thinking about real people like that, or possible people.

Where do I lie on this spectrum? I think somewhere in the middle, closer to thought theory, but the idea of active participation is important as well, of 'play'.

The paradox shows how powerful these mental simulations are. The stickiness of the debate helps us artists.

This 'reality' of emotions moves us into our reactions to mental simulations outside of literature, outside of fully-conscious, fictional simulation. 

Susan Feagin - pretending to care for fictional characters would not make sense, would it?

Magic Circle (lead on from Walton’s ideas)
“literature may help us to recognize and explore our fantasies without giving way to them” (Childs &amp; Fowler)
Formalists agreed that literature was set apart from everyday speech.
Oatley and Gholamain - “we can concentrate on our emotions and reflect on them in a safe place away from the ordinary world”
Brecht’s idea of catharsis - out of ‘magic circle’ and back into the real world.
- What Hepola calls “according to the story” (a predicate modifier) is a magic circle. Different from simpliciter properties.
Gibson’s ‘mock reader’.
Nell points out the inherent safety of narrative worlds - the magic circle.
We will come back to talk about this more in later chapters.
Conclusion
The idea of a character’s ‘resonance’, their most important and generic feature, arises out of the responses of the audience, which has a lengthening importance in literary and art theory. There are many different approaches to the reader’s response, all of which have some interest to the artist trying to create better characters artistically: ‘generating interest, and in particular emotional interest, in the represented world’, or ‘render representations attractive and keep distance at a minimum.’. The response of the audience, that which we are trying to court, arises out of their imaginative and mental capacities, what Wolf calls ‘aesthetic illusion’. This leads to the powerful responses to art which are at the centre of our culture, and which lead to the augmentation, some may say creation, of character. To design characters well, then, for an artist, is to build a character that courts this imaginative faculty. Despite this, Wolf points out, it has received “amazingly scant attention in research”. It’s also a difficult thing to calculate, because of the great variety of human psychology out there (“personal cosmologies” - Darill, Mergenthal, Gidders), and despite the attempts of scholars to codify ‘the reader’ into an ideal being. “These variables make it difficult, if not impossible, to decide on the actual illusionist effect of a given work, text, technique, etc. for all periods and all individuals.” Complicated by the author as reader, and critic as reader, human readers with their own faculties, as well. Also whether deliberate or accidental.
However, aesthetic illusion is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the human imaginative capacity: Childs &amp; Fowler point out that ‘fiction’, what we think of as writing imaginatively, is in fact more suited to the very act of imagination in the first place, an act which transcends the bounds of art: “All mental activity, it is claimed, is fictional because it involves shaping material which is inherently shapeless. We can only make sense of things by imposing fictions (shapes or interpretations) on them. ‘Fiction’ thus becomes a kind of umbrella, sheltering many different kinds of mental activity and cultural.”  “immersion seems to satisfy a powerful psychological predisposition“ This is unsurprising, considering reader-response criticisms close ties with psychology.Character as psychological mordant. It is important to look at these faculties, which we will do so next.
Not necessarily offerings answers, but &quot;a straightforward acceptance of something mysterious about human nature (our ability to be moved by what we know does not exist is illogical, irrational, even incoherent).
Norton, Norton and McClure - &quot;characterization is one of the most powerful literary elements&quot; - more so than the others re. Formalism.
&quot;Plot only exists because of character&quot; - Donald Graves - rather than the other way around. Roser, Martinez et. al(2007)
Calvino distinguishes aesthetic illusion from everyday illusion (re. wolf) using the term &quot;high fantasy&quot; - loftier part of the imagination.</Text>

            <Title>Autocosmics &amp; Wider Theories</Title>
            <Text>Defining This ‘Low Fantasy’

What does literary fantasising, this particular mental faculty, lie in opposition to, in Wolf’s eyes?
It is everything that relates to the human ability to create ‘illusion’ (I.e. to create mental simulations) outside of the purely artistic.
A very, very large topic, covering one of the most important, distinguishing and widespread human faculties, of which aesthetic illusion is just one subset, distinguished by the need for a “inciting representation”; in distinction to this is what Wolf somewhat dismisses as “delusions”, “conceptual and perceptual errors”, “hallucinations” and “dreams”. While art is very interested in these things as subjects (examples from art?), the role of such things in art are often set aside. Such things are more the purview of psychological, psychoanalytical and neuroscientific literature.
However, there is, I hope to show here, much crossover; much of what we could consider “non-literary” mental simulation can have inciting representations, often deliberate (advertising, for example), but often accidental and unformalised. Often, we might argue, what distinguishes it is the direct “phenomenology of our experiences” (Walton), rather than being parsed through a text. Not always, however. Can be within its own magic circle, can be participatory with which Huizinga called “the play attitude”, but often is forced upon us, or seems real: not defined by the “ambivalence” or deliberate participation which is, according to Wolf, part of the aesthetic illusion. Can often be part of the warp and weft of our lives, more deeply embedded, or afforded less sacred significance and space, than art itself.

“Make-believe and imagining are pervasive in human experience, by no means confined to our interactions with works of fiction… fiction [is] continuous with the rest of life.” (Walton, S&amp;S). 

&quot;The mental cinema is always at work in each one of us... [it never] stop[s] projecting images before our mind's eye.&quot; (Calvino) The mind’s 


A Nominal Definition

As with aesthetic illusion, there are many terms used to describe this faculty. It is not in the remit to discuss them all, merely draw them together in review. Very commonly it is called “imagination” (a citation?), “simulation” (a citation?) or “modelling” (a citation?), or many other things besides. Each of these have both specific and general meanings within different fields, which can muddy our high-level examination of the entirety of the phenomenon. For example, imagination is used in psychology to mean “all mental simulation”, as we mean it, as well as precisely to mean the simulation of prior sensory experiences.
Because of this, and to distinguish our transdisciplinary interest, I will be using a nominal definition, a term around which we can talk, and which we can use to stand for our general interest, whether aesthetic or mundane, incited or sourceless, deliberate or accidental, in the human hallucinatory faculty as an object of interest for artists.
The term I have chosen is AUTOCOSMICS. This means “self-worlds”, which I think captures the internalised, personal nature of mental simulation, as well as their immersiveness, as well as pointing to their atmospheric osmosis; how other mental faculties, and the world outside the self, can affect and influence them, like meteorites scarring the face of a world. The word ‘cosmos’, as well, to me stands for a system in tension, an interpolation of many moving parts, rather than the rather static “imagination”, which also confines us to the purely visual: though this is important, it is not the only way to ‘imagine’. We could have used the word ‘simulation’, which I think also preserves these qualities, but again its numerous popular and specific meanings make life difficult for us. Autocosmics, in being new and nominal, does not place any prior judgement or distinction between “high” and “low” fantasy, its source or purpose, only the fact of its existence as a phenomenon, its role within the individual, its varying degrees of immersion and its constant systemic evolution within a mind. I must admit to adapting it from another pleasing term, paracosm, used (but not coined) extensively by the developmental psychologist Marjorie Taylor to describe the detailed fictional worlds of both children, lunatics and artists. This cross-generational divide is a nice touch, as is the non-judgemental ascription to all human mental activity, which I feel is preserved in my term. 
This account, then, in referring to “autocosmics” in general, might be accused of being an act of “intellectual hubris” (an attempt to theorise everything, and thus nothing); but I am not trying to unite all mental simulation, or provide a grand theory, or link everything together; I merely want to draw attention to its ubiquity, and the different ways that it has been both courted, ignored and modified by different fields, with the concluding goal of looking outside my own disciplinary boundaries at other examples of this loose collection of human abilities.


Where Does It Come From?

[[This section might need more theoretical grounding]].

In plain English, from a combination of the mind and the body.

The power of the human brain as a computational object, to compute both internally to itself (memory, for example (cite)), and externally to the bodily. It is arguable whether mental simulation can be thought of as ever entirely mental: phenomenologists such as Andy Clark states that much of our cognition is out in the world (”extended cognition”). Merleau-Ponty talked about “the flesh of the world”, and Shapiro traces changes in more recent history from a “comfortably Cartesian view[s] of mind.&quot; To “the mind incarnate” (Shapiro).

David Deutsch - “it is uncontroversial that the human brain has capabilities that are, in some respects, far superior to those of all other known objects in the cosmos.” 

The processing of that information takes place within our brains: this is an evolutionary impulse. Holland - “General abilities based in the brain and shared by all human beings who have normal brains.”

It relies in general on two major components of mankind’s biology and psychology: the gathering of information and its processing, either in conjunction or merely processing. “Man… is… a receiver and transmitter of information… transforms the distillate of his world into memories, mental imagery… an information processor.” (Weiz p140). 
“The ability to interpret is not acquired; it is constitutive of being human.” Stanley Fish
What, at base, we try to do is make sense of this flood of sensory and mental data, constantly churning and changing all the time, which “stimulate people to look for causal connections.” As Donald Norman says, “the human mind is exquisitely tailored to make sense of the world”; we are “explanatory creatures” (cite?) who “assimilate reality into systems of transformations” ; mental systems that mean manipulating the raw data into internalised sense-made projections. This comes back the idea of accidental/deliberate; though we can deliberately tweak and make sense of certain things in certain ways, often it is accidental and uncontrolled: “give it the slightest clues and off it goes, providing explanation, rationalisation, understanding” . Very similar to the “integrative coherence” of aesthetic illusion from Wolf, in which the reader parses the text with their own lives. This is “reproductive imagination” (cite); reproducing (always partially) the data we receive from the world. This is contrasted with “constructive imagination”, or is in partnership with it; using the computational power of the brain to take existing concepts and build new ones out of them, or adapt mental constructs of sensory/bodily/worldly data and change them into something else. 
Indeed, this sense-making leads us to a wider use of the term ‘narrative’; a “mode of mental life” (Oatley) as a sequence of consistent events which are relatable and trackable, temporal and causal. It is how we explain the past, predict the future, and plot the present in continuum, give meaning to our existence and determine patterns over a long period of time. “Narrative [is] the most important cognitive macro-frame man has developed to make sense of experience in and of time” (Wolf). Vermeule says that narrative is so important, a &quot;human universal&quot;. &quot;narrative directly benefits survival&quot; (Greyman). Vermeule talks about narrative as grandly about social interaction, about social autocosmics - its not just imagining, its social imagining. Schank and Abelson 1995 (through Green and Donahue) claimed all knowledge is stories - &quot;somewhat overstated&quot;. &quot;Successful advancement through life - even survival - demands that people not only adapt to existing demands but also.anticipate.and.prepare.for.demands.that.may.emerge.in.the.future&quot; - Carroll and Shepperd -&gt; mental simulation is a big part of this.
In Unspeakable Sentences (1982), the narrative theorist Ann Banfield declares that “the language of narrative has the resources for a picture of the activities and states of the mind commensurate wi the most sophisticated theories of knowledge and consciousness&quot;.





 [[Is there a specific example of this which demonstrates all these concepts? Of both taking data from the world, and adapting existing mental constructs, both deliberately and accidentally, into an explanatory narrative which also relates to our interest in characters?]]

EMPATHY!

Taking the view of another. Chris Allen Thomas - “empathy is the ability of people to recognise and respond to the emotions of others”. M.H. Davis - empathy is the “reactions of one individual to the observed experiences of another.” - “simulates what is going on in another person’s mind” (Feagin).
Different from sympathy, which is the emotional response to the emotional experiences of another as other, as opposed to empathy, which involves a degree of perspective-taking; of understanding not just the situation externally, but the mental situation internally. Relates to German term Einfuhlung (”feeling into”). Dunn (1988) states that maybe it is difficult to separate these two states.
(Margaret Morris) Either cognitive Empathy - deliberate “perspective taking”, or emotional empathy, which is mostly-unconscious sharing of emotions due to emotional contagion. 
Relies entirely on the ability to simulate the minds of the other, a “theory of mind” or what Alison Lee calls “mentalising”. and can produce very strong emotional responses (similar to emotion in fiction, though actually based on reality?). Part of what Davies &amp; Stone call “folk psychological practice”, “a practice in which we all engage on an everyday basis.”
Required because of the hard problem of consciousness, the inaccessibility of other minds (citation?) - tied to qualia (introduced by CI Lewis in 1929) - “the subjective or qualitative properties of experiences.” (Kind), including “perceptual experiences, bodily sensations, felt reactions and emotions and felt moods” . These are very difficult to study, and their existence has caused “considerable controversy in philosophy of mind” (Kind). “In one sense, as Laing says, we are invisible to each other.” (Palmer). 
&quot;empathic accuracy&quot; - myers and hodges reporting it - how accurately can you infer the content of the feelins of others.
BIOLOGICAL BASIS - Kohler (infants gain self-objectification and empathy at 2); Farrow et. Al (2001) and Oschner et. Al (2004) found the precuneus and prefrontal cortex and left superior frontal gyrus as important for empathy.
Vogeley &amp; Fink (2003) - Precuneus (in the brain) is associated with the taking of perspectives, both first-person and spatial third-person, with differental activation in the bilateral precuneus when first-person (bcause of agency?), though Alison Lee is not sure whether this is the source of mental imagery, or the mechanism by which we understand the perspectives of others.
Very, very important to human society. “The importance of empathy is indisputable because it plays a vital role in human social behavior as well as in the behavior of some non-human species” (Rodrigues et al.) Frans de Vaal - a “mammalian characteristic” -&gt; communicate at an emotional level with our pets. Emotional empathy in voles. Goes against the idea that everything is based on selfish motives in the animal kingdom (in his book Empathy: Its Ultimate &amp; Proximal Bases), and opens up intriguing debates on theory of mind in animals. Some see it, however as HIS autocosmics.
Humphrey and Crook - social animals need cues. -”probably has an innate basis” - “we are designed by natural selection to assume that other people have similar mental experiences to ourselves”. So, social interdependence leads to the need for simulation.

Extensions Of Audience Response Theory Into Psychology (Overlap of “High” Fantasy &amp; “Low” Fantasy)

Childs &amp; Fowler - “Since I. A. Richards’s Principles of Literary Criticism (1924), critics have usually been wary of detailed explorations into reader psychology: ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ (Coleridge) is now more often alluded to than investigated.” - this is not true at all! Massive link between reader-response theory and psychology.

“What is more, improvements in psychology and neuroscience have lent even more credence to the reader-response position, as we are now able to offer scientific proof – the 'facts' that the Formalists were so keen on – as to what is happening in an audience's mind when they engage with a literary work.” (Literature &amp; The Brain, 2009)

Gerrig's work - &quot;that fiction... has the same status that illusions have for psychologists interested in perception”.

Not all reader-response theorists are like Childs &amp; Fowler and Wolf - Holland Interested in the difference between individual responses, and how wider human responses to things coincided with literary responses. He talks about dreams, and slips of the tongue.


 ————————————————————————————————————————————————— ——————————

We see here that there is a lot of (and increasing) overlap between the study of psychology and the study of literature: important discoveries are made linking general principles of mental simulation and specific aesthetic illusion. An interesting conclusion from it: Reader is not all-powerful, as some reader-response theory categorises them - subject to powerful outside forces and internal forces (autocosmics), and they bring many of their wider autocosmic faculties into their appreciation of art. The degree to which this happens, and the extent of similarity between “real-world” autocosmics and “art-world” autocosmics is still a subject of debate. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

NeuroImage 2006 study and Emory University 2012: the brain lights up areas that deal with texture and smell when dealing with descriptions, metaphors and similes that employ these techniques. Words like “lavender,” “cinnamon” and “soap,” for example, elicit a response not only from the language-processing areas of our brains, but also those devoted to dealing with smells.
Motor cortex stimulated when reading about physical activity (Boulenger study)
Mar (2011) - fMRI studies - overlap between reading about stories and parts of brain used for interpersonal interaction.
Nicolopoulos &amp; Richner - “Results indicated that children's representation of characters shifted from almost exclusively physical and external portrayals of &quot;actors&quot; at 3 to increasing inclusion of &quot;agents&quot; with rudimentary mental states at 4 and of &quot;persons&quot; with mental representational capacities by 5.” Their method involved splitting ‘character’ from ‘plot’ development. “Misleading” previous research putting this ability much later in children.
The centres of emotional perception in the brain - pleasant imagery in nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex connected with amygdala for both. &quot;Narrative emotional imagery&quot; using fMRI, see how these all connect. NuC and MePrefCortex throughout. &quot;engages a core appetitive circuit&quot;
The brain reacts to imagined imagery in the same way as to real stimuli. (Costa, Lang et al. 2010)
Simo Saatela’s look at the Startle Effect in film (her disputation of the Paradox of Fiction) and its “mistaken identification” with real fear and danger.
Cohen’s comparisons of “identification with media characters” with identification in “other interpersonal contexts… such as stories heard around a campfire or at a slumber party, or in highly emotional interpersonal conversations, such as in support groups.”
Emory University - A compelling novel causes changes in the brain - heightened activity in regions of the brain associated with physical sensation and movement when reading something with a dramatic plot.
Directs In Empirical Literary Studies (2008) - reading prose by Chekhov is different from reading documentary-style text with the same context. “By projecting ourselves into fictional stories and the minds of fictional characters, we open ourselves up to greater possibilities for who we may become.”
Kid &amp; Castano - reading literature improves intuitive abilities.
Peter Bazalgette - the arts promote empathy.
Oatley &amp; Mar (2006 and 2007) - reading fiction makes you more empathetic.
Calvino writes about qualia, and posits that it may be the basis for all writing - &quot; [to] give speech to that which has no language&quot; 
Norman Holland looked at psychoanalytic psychology.
Working with Reading Groups: (Holland, Richard Long, “playful” discussions - &quot;they actively constructed meanings together, based on such issues as character, identifications, and the moral qualities of the books as they related to the member's own lives.&quot; Keith Oatley’s work with reading groups, a &quot;profound... meeting of minds&quot;. Bleich's symbolisation and resymbolisation tests - no objective reading, based on their own experiences. Steig and Slatoff's experimentations. Berman looks at emotively-charged discussion - kind of like therapy.
Cohen links empathy creation with identification with media characters - part of the emotional learning of children.
Discover the phonology (the sounds of names) allow you to discriminate the roles of characters.
Name of character predicts their role - like bouba/kiki.
Miall and Kuiken use techniques from neuropsychology.
Heart Rate test - hear rate change when listing to a story. language regions and auditory regions are triggered. No distinction in body between real and unreal.
In fact, lots of cross-over. Very related to psychology, and has been linked to psychological advances, particularly post-behaviourists
Blakey Vermeule - &quot;Why are humans so utterly obsessed with one another?&quot; - literature helps our empathic centres. &quot;socially, in other words, reading fiction is good for us (Greyman)&quot;. Vermeule is all over cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. Calls empathy &quot;mind-reading&quot;
Evolutionary literary criticism, or literary Darwinism - the role of the cognitive, and the developmental, in the literary.
&quot;the one thing that interests [the audience] most is themselves.&quot; (in Disney Book).
Alan Palmer - Fictional Minds - how we can “know” the minds of people in books”. Uses psycholuinguistics and all that stuff. He thinks that narrative fiction lags behind cognitive science in terms of understanding the presentation of fictional minds. Not just fictional minds, but their objective social nature in relation to other minds.In one sense to read“she felt happy”is the most natural thin the world: we know what it is to feel happy. Inanothersense,itistheoddest:we do not know and can never know what it is to experience directly how another person can feel happy. We base our knowledge of fictional people on empathic conjecture and evidence of their behaviour, just like real opeople. Thought is public, and social. We broadcast our inner states. 
Miall details the 2004/5 start of focussing on &quot;cognitive processes&quot; when reading, not just the political/social/historical reality of the book. He is definitely reader-response. Sees it as a way to go &quot;beyond interpretation&quot; - to look at the very real place that literature has in people's minds. To break down the &quot;processes... and sub-processes&quot; involved in reading in the mind. Looking at specifics. This ties &quot;aesthetic illusion&quot; to the wider issues of &quot;illusion&quot;. Interpretation is &quot;only one corner&quot; of a much larger field. How the reader interprets a work is plugged into the wider summa of human experience. (i.e. autocosmics).

Quick Conclusion

“Psychological processes do not happen in books but in people” - a character’s resonance, for an audience member, is inextricably tied to their wider autocosmic faculties. &quot;Emotions are things experienced by sentient beings... not by books and films&quot; (Murray Smith)

Autocosmics, then, is not what lies outside literature: it is the sum of the human faculty of mental simulation and virtuality, of which Wolf’s “aesthetic illusion” is a part. Indeed, it is scalar, part of a continuum, and the distinctions between mundane narrative cognition and aesthetic narrative cognition are less clear than perhaps Wolf makes out, or perhaps, if not less clear, then less relevant. The distinction between aesthetic and mundane, real and fictional, true emotion and quasi-emotion, is difficult to countenance, and battles rage on. What seems to be true in the recent psychology/literary theory/neuroscience corssovers is that art is &quot;emotionally potent... a kind of emotional truth that we experience at a biochemical level&quot;. “On a neurobiological level, our experience of consuming fiction is actually very real.”
Narrative is not a faculty unique, or even necessarily originating in, art: it is something which we have always used to interpret the world around us, and our own minds and its constructs. Character, as a concept, is something which transcends literature as well: it is part of our experience of narrative, it is how we make sense of and compartmentalise the acts and supposed thoughts of other agents.
We therefore, as artists trying to create good characters, create ‘resonance’ through the courting of the entire autocosmic faculty of human beings; of understanding the links between a character portrayed on screen and the piece of hay blowing across a car park which looks like a spider; the similarities between relating to other real people and written people; the wider context of these supposedly delimited imaginations which are our object of study and artifice. This holds much interest to us; this context of pattern-matching, narratisation, sense-making etc, across human culture, not just art. Perhaps then art will not only speak of human culture and human cognition; it will court it more widely, in a formal sense, in their audiences as well. 
There are many, many fields of research which I have taken inspiration from in this sense, and where I can show elements of narrative or artistic interest where perhaps there is not a great deal of interest already .
Counterfactual Thinking (Imagination Book), imaginary Friends, a form of &quot;fantasy production&quot; in children (Taylor, Shawber et. al, 2008), daydreaming “an essential componet of people’s equipment for functioning” (Klinger, 2008). (Markman, Karadogan et. al, 2008) courting superstition. Beilock and Lyons (2008) - mental visualisation in experts, research into Possible Selves by (Oyserman &amp; James 2008), affecting our behaviour now. 
The study of character is becoming “an increasingly interdisciplinary intellectual field.” (Felski)
. Perhaps the most important example for my narrative, however, is that of superstition, and religion: key to Yocto’s narrative, and Anne’s. An example of human autocosmics not relating to objective fact, of being irrational. Here, the narrative importance and interest, both inside and out, is most keenly seen; in the disconnect between the objective outside world and how it is parsed, reproduced and constructed by the human imagination. It is these “errors” which offer much aesthetic potential.</Text>

This is the focus of my narrative, precisely because it is about the power of the human imagination, and its artistic potential beyond the modern concept of the “aesthetic”, and within our everyday lives.

Superstition

A very ancient (and very current!) form of human autocosmics: the attribution of causality to unknown or unrelated forces through cultural naivety or norms.“False causality is the basis for much superstition.” “In the past gave order to a chaotic and unpredictable world.” Sir James Frazer's 'classic' (Hutton) definition of magic - practices designed to bring spiritual or supernatural forces under the control of human agents. Dealing with systems, complexity, the unknown… (Plato) “Magic is, in fact, everything that absolutely fascinates minds and attract souls by means of words and deeds… they are difficult for the mind to perceive, and their causes are veiled from the simpleton. That is because it is a divine force associated with advanced reasons for the purpose of understanding it.” &quot;the world of popular belief and custom... practical remedies for specific problems&quot; “The unknown with the belief, even amongst the superstitious, that there existed credible rules for its control.” Opies say that supersititon have too much weight as a word - could not ask about those. Ritual (Hutton) - &quot;formal, dramatic and unusually stylized action&quot;. McClenon - shamanic ritual and placebo effect - actually is a signal to the body that it can survive. Those who are susceptible to placebo did get better. p97 - 100 - he talks about cargo cults as e.g. of religion as &quot;intentional stance&quot;. &quot;the raw materials of religion&quot;. Building on Boyer's work - systems in the human brain in tandem allow proto-religious thoughts. Hypnotism as the placebo effect, hallucinogens and ethnogens (building on McClenon's work). &quot;supernormal stimuli&quot; - bigger than life stimuli that we gravitate towards. Characters are examples of these. &quot;a well-designed few&quot; make it through to become solid ideas. &quot;saturating the human environment with folk psychology&quot;. Religion as instinct, and may actually be better to have a general myth that everybody agrees on (and which we all end up following becausse everybody does) than misunderstanding the actual reason on our own. &quot;better safe than sorry&quot;
“The word has long been used in a derogatory sense to describe what were perceived to be unfounded, credulous or heretical beliefs. Ancient Roman and Greek authors applied it to ‘uncivilised’ people outside the Classical world. The early Church used it in its campaign against the pagan religions which it ultimately vanquished.”
Skinner's work on superstition (i.e. the basal pattern matching) in pigeons. Is a version of autocosmics, of mental simulation, of causality. &quot;In a species that does represent both itself and other agents to itself, the effect can be multiplied.&quot; 
When we speak about superstition generally, we are often talking about extra-religious or folk beliefs. v. relevant to my story. Anne lives in a time when ‘false’ inferences about the natural world were battling with both organised inferences (I.e. the Bible) and science. Davies - “magical activities were no longer considered as technically feasible but rather explicitly fraudulent pretences designed to fool the credulous”. (After Witchcraft Act of 1736). Often called “the long 18th century” because of the perceived change in social, political and personal identities from 1700 to 1800. Anne is placed right in the middle. “Intellectually the whole basis for witchcraft and magic was being questioned.” (In Davies) John Dove “foolish artifices… against mischief merely imaginary”. very negative, not as benign as now.The concept was a &quot;cultural weapon&quot; against the piopulace.  Superstition could be grouped under ‘popular magic’. Distinguished from ‘high magic’.
But still lots of people believed in magic.Keith Thomas was the first point of academic reference in 70s - said magic ‘declined’ in 18th century. Fits with Enlightenment narrative. De Bleacourt and other recent scholars dispute this. “It was appropriated as an Enlightenment tool, and added to the arsenal of words used to enforce a self-conscious intellectual and cultural break with the past.” “It is too crude and misleading to portray the Enlightenment as a period of intellectual and social leaps” “Yet the majority of people across Europe undoubtedly felt exactly the same about witches, and much else besides, whether they lived in the early seventeenth century or the early nineteenth century.” Davies &amp; de Blecourt (BTWT) “so-called enlightenment”. BTWT that it continued for centuries, despite the enlightenment. Brian Hoggard - “continuation and survival of witchcraft practices”. “The decline of magic was a slow and long drawn-out affair.” Gap between complex ambivalence of popular culture and the simplistic dichotomy preached by the church in relation to spirits. “the debrus of many different thoughts.” (Thomas). “The line between orthodoxy and heresy [was] extremely thin” “The opposition between modern academic categories and contemporary indigenous ones.” The elite and the people often believed the same thing, but there were class-defined manifestations of superstition. Dyer deals with this an awful lot. Davies’ demographic breakdown of visitors to cunning folk; many rich and educated people.Priests becoming cunning folk. Priests were often cunning-folk (or at least astrologers) - thought that they were helping their parishioners 

The Anglican Chrich “had long given up on trying to suppress popular magic at grassroots level”. “The attempt by the theologicans to wipe out the distinction between black and white witches by branding them both as diabolical never got through to the people to whom these witches ministered” (thomas). Witchcraft Act not repealed until 1952 (from Hutton). Examples from Anne’s time - witch marks “making the world a safer, less hostile place.” (Duncan Wilson, guardian article). Just a quick reference to the article on burying stuff in walls and floors, just like Anne does. Dolls cut in half, belt buckles, knives, human skull and cross-bones, a donkey buried under the barn. “Spiritual armory of the house” As Roberta Harding says - blood was used, aristocracy’s heads, from beheading, were sources of superstitious ingredients. Cultural nature of it - fulfilling a need as healthcare was bad. “Superstitions function as a form of public healthcare”. &quot;individual christians seeking success and security in their daily lives by their own efforts&quot;. Systems are hard - therefore divination is a way to make these decisions. &quot;candidates to press into service as decision aids&quot;
Cunning folk - “provided numerous magical services to assuage the illnesses, fears, misfortunes and desires of the general populace”. &quot;cunning folk seem to have been virtually immune from legal harrassment&quot;. “Two hundred years ago the majority of the population… would have known at least one cunning-man or cunning-woman.” “Individuals who straddled the worlds of both learned and low magic”. “Curing the mad, bad and sad” - sufferers of their autocosmics, or rather of the world! Setting up “supernatural protection rackets”. &quot;rival therapists for the community's affliction&quot;. Demons were behind cunning-folk work, they said. 
Familiars (like the Spyrit) - “the affectionate and intimate relationship often found between the witch/cunning woman and her familiar/fairy”. Belief in fairies was much lesser. “Both familiars and fairies were elieved to possess a range of supernatural powers that were considered capable of affecting almost any aspect of human life”. Parallel to the hobman, “living alone… either alongside humans in their houses”. Characterised superstition. “Substances such as ale or milk were often poured on springs, trees and rocks sacred to fairies, while bowls of bread, milk or water and suchlike were left in the kitchen overnight for the domestic hobman”. Familiars - “clearly-defined, three-dimensional… forms, vivid with colour and animated with movement and sound” - just like computer character! “This old hag travelled with a Guinea pig in her breast, which she pretended solved questions” - autocosmic pets.The Devil as a character - a person only experienced through mediation - witch trials, saying his name etc. Belief in “brownies” “liv[ing] alongside humans in theor own houses and farms”, working by night, cannot be controlled, only supplicated by cream and porridge on the hearth. Belief in fairies persisted in Scotland, but waned in England. Changelings, superstitious use of wells, 2nd sight (again in Scotland, p. 87). Marks funereal rituals (and perhaps ghosts and spirit systems) as a tension between inability to remove one's intentional stance to the dead other and needing to remove the physical, possibly diseased physical reminder of them. And that these characters could evolve, free of physical reality, 
Animal forms, not particularly supernatural. Perhaps because of fear of the unnatural as being outside God, also because animals formed a symbiotic relationship with everyday people. (Wilby) “The familiar most frequently appeared in animal form, often living in domestic intimacy with the witch.”
Consensus - not necessarily belief, but a socially-mandated ‘playing’, a magic circle, in many regards. Dyer (BTWT) asserts that from the sufferer’s perspectives, it was an autocosmic maelstrom both informed by their supernatural beliefs and social/familial expectations - the cunning-person allowed ‘blessed relief’ - a consensual end to the autocosmics. “Genuine respect moderated by doses of cynicism”. This time period was definitely when the magic circle started to actually grow in strength - difference between affirmative ritual and truth.&quot;R.R Marrett agreed that ritual was essential and belief secondary... emotion rather than reason was the key&quot; (398)


Religion

Dennett: “We can analuse the artifice in religious texts and ceremonies just as we can analuse the artifice in literature in other arts.&quot; (154). &quot;Design and techniques&quot; of religion, &quot;amalgam of brilliant plays and stratagems&quot;. &quot;religion's contrary&quot; - of course, we can draw the same autocosmic arguments about religion. Church people - &quot;unbridgeable gulf between... religion and magic&quot;. 
Evolutionary theory applied to religious beliefs - have survived over time because they seem to work. &quot;folk religions&quot; - pretty much superstitions organise - &quot;vestigial traces&quot; in organised religion. &quot;evolved product of many adjustements&quot;. &quot;free-floating rationales&quot; -&gt; &quot;carefully-crafted reasons&quot;. Linking it to memes - infectious ideas. Belief is the core differentiation between superstition and religion. 
Talks about the commeasurate evolutionary fitness of language and religion, both to &quot;genetic fitness&quot; and &quot;cultural fitness&quot; - clear benefits, mutualists. In religion, resonance is the ultimate - they will die, not just be bad, if not used.
folk religion is superstition and organised religion is different - in the previous (according to Dennett) people don't think of themselves as practicing a religion - it is just life. Relgiion is more like art, a bounded space outside of life. Therefore let us think of art more like folk art.
Difficult to separate superstition and religion: both rely on autocosmic simulation: to seek patterns, to mentally simulate, to create complex narrative out of sensory and mental percepts. Brown and Holden - science and magic, to the layman, differ only in idiom. Both rely on character, gods as agents (Dennett). Holy texts provide characters that have resonated for thousands of years - Muhammad, Jesus, the prophets. They are both allegorical and individual. Gods are manifestations of the autocosmic, and our relationship with the world around us. “magic and religion - “terms notoriously difficult to define”
For Harding, they are “a manifestation of humankind’s longstanding effort to comprehend the elementary principles of good and evil.” “powerful manifestations of our own fears and hopes and dreams. The invention - the finding within of gods represents our reach for the transcendent.” McCorduck - “human yearning for the transcendent”.

An illusion, but did Calvino think that it was “high” fantasy”? - &quot;the believer is called upon personally to paint frescoes crowded with figures on the walls of his mind, starting out from the stimuli that his visual imagination succeeds in extracting from the theological proposition of a laconic verse from the gospels&quot;. Critics made the links between literature (specifically poetry) and religion/play, particularly religion of individual people, rather than liturgy. (Huizinga).
Big links between superstition in the time period that I am looking at and religion: many of the grimoires used religious language, particularly Catholic (re. Book of Soyga), “relics of old Catholicism” in popular culture. “Catholicism possessed a fundamental vehicle… ability to use visual communication.” Cunning folk techniques “often contained a large component of Christianity”, and “the Bible… [was] regularly treated as a magical object in itself”; “made a show of using the Bible in their consulting rooms”. Examples of priests who were cunning folk, or who believed in the power of superstition. “Cunning-folk borrowed from Catholic practices”. “No known case of a cunning person or charmer calling upon a pagan deity”. Clergy were the biggest users and makers of magical books. “Intrinsic Christian content of magic.” “dusty Catholic mysticism”
Examples of what would probably be called “aesthetic illusion” in religion - Boxley Rood - people were complicit in magic circle, not duped or fooled - ‘pretended’ it was a real miracle, gave donations to the monks. But why did they pretend? Part of their wider autocosmic relationship with the world, “more complicated” than simply belief or pantomime. A “theatrical miracle” (Groeneveld). Criticism tied to “sweeping away of Catholic mysticism”. Stories about it getting down, attacking women, could both worship and be entertained by them. “personal affective responses”. A piece of installation art, just like Yocto. Groeneveld states that removing and parading the Rood before destruction was designed to decontextualise it, to bring it into the “harsh light of day” rather than the theatrical settings of the monastery. The spoilsporting is really interesting here. (Murray) Religious services are designed as narrative bottlenecks, to control people’s exposure to the machinery of the divine - not fraudulent, merely reliant on both sides performing in a certain way, after being given the furniture of the suspension of disbelief. Bocca Della Verita - a proto-arcade autocosmic machine. (still a massive queue to see it)
Prayers being answered - we are in a performative state of mind to see a ‘sign’, or a way. Acheiropoieta - religious images made without human intervention - Turin Shroud, images in toast.
&quot;a certain element of 'make-believe' is operative in all primitive religions... the really important thing is the //mood//.&quot;
“What becomes of the divintiy when it reveals itself in icons, when it is multiplied in simulacra… the visible machinery of icons substituted for the pure and intelligble Idea of God?” - against baudrillard idea - icons and “graven images” excite the imagination. People were “content to venerate a filigree God” “already enacting his death and his disappearance in the eipophany of his representations” - this is a big subject, but I don’t think that God disappears because he is an icon, or into his icons. “But what if God can be sumulated… can be reduced to the signs that constitute faith? Then the whole system becomes weightless.”
Like superstition, religion is an example of autocosmic phenomenon outside of the purely literary or artistic: an interactive parlay with our own minds and the minds of those around us, with a wide magic circle and a powerful narrative and character-led streak; something before which we are not entirely helpless, but which we instead luxuriate ourselves in. “Ah, you realize that magick is something we do to ourselves. But it is more convenient to assume the objective existence of an angel who gives us new knowledge than to allege that our invocation has awakened a supernormal power in ourselves.” (Kaczynski, 542)[11. Dogma is the contradictory heart of human religion. Religion is born and thrives on autocosmics; dogma seeks to control the human imagination and conscious thought. It never works, not completely.


Superstition-As-Autocosmics Today

“Even though principles of rationality seem as often violated as followed, we still cling to the notion that human thought should be rational, logical and orderly.” (Donald Norman). “Reason has not ended our relationship with magic.” (Davies).“Even in today’s technologically advanced and scientifically sophisticated society, they continue to be part of the cultural landscape.” (Roberta Harding). &quot;fossil traces of animism&quot; in how we treat modern-day things. &quot;treat things as agents with beliefs and desires&quot; (Dennett). &quot;astrology-seekers and numerologists who still inhabit our high-tech Western culture&quot;.Links belief in primitive forces to our own beliefs in what we cannot see and touch (atoms etc.)
Often confine it to children, and indeed much research has been done on the superstitions of children, most notably the Opies on the work of “half-beliefs” of children in the 1950s. (Hickling &amp; Wellman 2001), particularly in how they conduct animism (Turkle, Gjersoe) and have imaginary friends (Gjersoe, Marjorie Taylor). But much research has also been done into how this can extend into adulthood (Gjersoe, Leonards, Connelly, Bloom &amp; Hood, 2009), and how these initial ways of looking at the world are not shrugged off, but change throughout our lives.
Religion is still a mightily powerful force in the world: the power of words, the vividness of its literary characters, the belief in a supernatural influence over the world, the constant autocosmic searching for answers within established frameworks.Hutton questions whether cunning-craft ever died out - merely metamorphosed into &quot;alternative&quot; therapies of today.
Also still extremely superstitious. Study in 2009 (Theos) 39% of adults believe in ghosts, 22% believe in reincarnation and 22% believe in astrology. Belief in cunning folk persisted into the twentieth century, and scholars like Hutton believes that there is a continuum with modern day superstitious behaviour, buoyed by scientific progress. Older writers (such as Malinowski) believed that magical thinking and superstition in the modern age is clearly non-Western and ‘savage’ in nature. Not true at all. Even with scientific advancement, our autocosmics are not completely controllable by reason, and the line between ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ autocosmics is very thin. OCD as an example(), homeopathy(), clean eating(), animism in the elderly with dementia (Zaitchik and Solomon 2008) . Belief in astrology is still quite high, &quot;astrology is pervasive in Western society&quot;, even amongst science students (). We still approach much of the world in a “pre-theoretical” (Ullman), naive manner, creating our own narratives, and culturally-enforced narratives, for the way things are. And creating characters is a big part of that! Still use anthropomorphism in our science (names of stars, and the Zodiac). &quot;The paranormal [for some] determines the devisions they may make about important events in their lives&quot;. Legare &amp; Souza (2012) - rituals are a &quot;cognitive paradox&quot;. 'simpatias' in Brazil - &quot;intutive causal principles&quot; - time of day, repetition of procedures - just like with the creature! Relate this forward to manuals/grimoires. It *seems&quot; like they should work. And &quot;transcendental influence&quot; (presence of religious iconography - make rituals more effective. The character of ritual, the setting, the context, the techniques used to stimulate the autocosmic (just like character).
Even less dramatic than this: at a low level, our brains are geared towards find causal links from seeming correlations, maintaining internal logic when we cannot maintain total external logic, as the world outside is not completely known. This combined with counter-factual thinking (), imagining alternatives to the world as we know it, can have powerful effects on us psychologically and physically, and change our behaviour to maintain those states. Often made worse by stress (Keinan, 1994). The Barnum Effect(), the Placebo Effect (Neil 1980, Van Raalte, Brewer, Nemeroff and Linder 1991), conducting rituals when mourning reduces grief (Norton &amp; Gino, 2013), Simulation Heuristic (Kahneman and Tversky) and how it can go wrong amongst those with clinical anxiety (Raune, Macleod and Holmes 2005) (Nan &amp; her not getting on her tram at the last minute, plane crash survivors who changed flights at the last minute) - and lots of research has been done into how rituals before sports can change our performance (Foster &amp; Weigand 2006, Mamassis and Doganis 2003, Damisch, Stoberock and Mussweiler 2010); indeed, in “any situation where the outcome is important and uncertain and beyond their control”. And even when we do not directly ‘believe’ in the causation at hand, just doing the actions can have positive psychological effects. Within a ‘magic circle’. “Unnecessary to consciously believe in the superstition.” Pareidolia - seeing faces.“The power of positive thinking has been proven to have physiological beenfits, and so, in this sense at least, magic may have worked.” “Merely providing a concrete diagnosis of witchcraft could have a beneficial, psychosomatic effect.”
 The same apparatus that we use to enjoy stories, to augment and create characters ourselves, is used out in the “real” world. &quot;Each one of us is now forced to do for ourselves what in previous ages was done by family, custom, church, and state - namely, create for ourselves the myths that will let us make some sense of experience.&quot; (May)

“[Collingwood] says there is a term for the techniques of deliberate evocation of specific emotions, though it is usually applied to cultures other than our own. This term is 'magic'. In our society too such techniques abound: producing warm feelings towards other members of our community or hostile feelings towards members of other communities, inducing preference for a politician, prompting an inclination to buy a particular product. Such ordinary magic is not pseudo-science, but pseudo-art. Thriller writing is a form of such ordinary magic, it involves using words and actions in a preconceived plan to have a calculated emotional effect.” (Oatley).

&quot;intentional object&quot; - that which is the focus of our pattern-matching.

            <Title>Introductory Comments</Title>
            <Text>The narrative, and thus character, of Anne, Yocto and the others in lots of different forms, and expressed in different ways - the “paratextual” (Genette) material of my PhD (the website etc.), the installation itself, the Housekeeping - but the focus of my work, at least from a theoretical and critical point of view, is the masterbeast - the computational artwork or component at the installation’s heart, and to which everything else is centred. It is the part about which I am least certain, and open to the most unique contribution, and theoretical difficulty.
I began as a writer - came to making art with computers late (BCP etc.) - and has proved an interesting and continuing challenge to me as a practitioner. Large part of the PhD was to afford myself the time and space to learn new techniques and theory, as well as bringing my own (unique, perhaps dilletante or interdisciplinary) perspective to the creation of characters as part of computational art.

One More Definition - How Am I Defining Digital Computational Art?

Lots of different terms, ideas and affordances wrapped up in this, so I want to clarify - especially what sets it apart from the other media in Project knole. It isn’t trying to be comprehensive - just want to define those things that we are interested in by linking them by a particular set of qualities that they share, from a methodological perspective - that is, in their physical medium, the tools that an artist could potentially employ to create that artwork.

‘New Media’ (Manovich) covers it in part, but this includes non-artistic media, more utilitarian media. Computational art is, arguably, a subset of new media, or is certainly included within its Venn. Tavinor confines his definition of games to 'visual media' - but I'm interested in the computation, rather than the visual element, which is a part of the representation, and is not unique. 
Not ‘digital’ - a bugbear. Manovich states that it has been used too much in discourse. Talking about the technology rather than what it affords or allows in terms of art. Also ‘digital art’ can just mean using the computer as part of production.The rise of the computer as a “universal media machine” (Manovich, p69) - this is just reproducing artworks from other media. We are not interested in this, but ‘digital’ is part of what distinguishes our version of ‘computational’, and it will be implicit within it. Not all digital tools are computational in and of themselves.
Not to do with ‘technology', as the book is a technology; want to move away from that discussion. A naturalised one, one to which we are wedded and almost don’t think about. “Eventually, all successful storytelling technologies become ‘transparent’” - I would like to contribute to this. “Technology is the abstract by which people engage with technics” - making things work - too general. As Mullaney says, art and technology are “inextricably linked” - technology does not distinguish this artform.
Not ‘game’ - though videogames are what I am looking at primarily (Ryans middle-of-the road-art comment, most examples, largest audience, and we are interested in audience). Games are a subset, imposes restrictions lexically and associatively, if not actually, on what we can talk about. Is a very naturalistic expression of computational art. Also have “long, non-wired histories” (NWF and Pat Harrigan). No words must design says “it’s adaptable to any and every technology, from the neolithic to the high tech”. Much of the response/criticism I will be using is tied to games, but I will try to uncouple any specificities. &quot;Games  are  perhaps  the  first  designed  interactive systems  our  species  invented.&quot; He sees game as covering all &quot;interactive experiences&quot; - &quot;interactive entertainment //means// games&quot; - but it is a word that is controversial in the discourse currently, and is part of the issues with computational characters. We are looking at things outside of games. “Rule-based formal system with a variable and quantifiable outcome” - like parts of this - “causally-linked series of challenges in a simulated environment” (Adams &amp; Rollings) - also has parts of it which are useful. Disagree with Juul’s &amp; S+Z’s definition of a ‘quantifiable outcome’ - maybe for a game, but not for the computer. The computer allows art to have different qualities and potentials, many of which it shares with games. Samyn and Harvey say that games are not art, but rather we have “real-time art”. The videogames industry is strangling artistry. “Not games”, and artgames (Felen Parker).  As a new form of media and pop culture, computer and video games also participate in global cultural trends in a way that board games do not.&quot;
Difference between paida (simulation) and ludus (game) - a game has winners and losers, both have rules. Rules are the thing. Making them computational implicitly includes things like rules. And the binary logic of ludus is too restrictive.
Not ‘interactive’ - even worse than “game” or “digital”. Manovich sees it as too broad to be useful.  All art is interactive (reader-response) and Manovich (56) - points to film montage and participatory art in the 1960s. Some argue that interactivity must be materially interactive (Andy Cameron), Salen + Zimmerman allow for a ‘multivalent model of interactivity’. Cognitive Interactivity, Functional Interactivity, Explicit Interactivity and Beyond-The-Object interactivity interactivity. So while explicit interactivity is often a *more* unique selling point of games, not unique. “None of these definitions resolve the question of whether or not all media, or even all experiences, are interactive.” Re. Laurel - “people seemed to regard interactivity as the unique cultural discovery of the electronic age” - not true, of course. Zimmerman - &quot;have you ever seen such a suspicious set of slippery and ambiguous, overused and ill-defined terms?&quot; No words must design - interactivity doesn’t mean much. Klug makes point that it is interacting with story or interacting with medium - but that’s not what is important. We will take it as implied. Almost implicitly includes interaction these days. Forum theatre (Frasco) is also interactive. Newman points out that games do not just derive their pleasure through interaction. Ergodic (Aarseth) might be better)
‘Non-linear’ is not necessarily the word we are looking for, or ‘dynamic’. Can mean different things in different media. Oulipo - writing as constrained, as imaginative, vindicating the constraints of gamemaking, and Jean Pierre Enard’s multiple choice theatre “Oulipan texts thus become the literary consequences of these axioms” - the emergent experiences of rules. Non-linear books (examples? Inc. Recipes books and guidebooks, ‘random-access nature’ of books), non-linear plays (examples?)

Computational gets to the heart of what separates this type of art from others. That is, the manipulation and transformation of information, in real time, is an intrinsic part of the artistic expression - things are computed. Still not a perfect term - Oulipo could be considered ‘computational art’, and computation is not strictly digital - (other examples? Improvisational theatre?) - so we need to prefix it with something like ‘digital’, ‘electrical’, ‘modern’ - but perhaps I can take it to be implied that I am referring to any form of human artistic expression which uses the computational abilities of modern, digital computer technology as a thematically integral and intentional part of the author’s expression and/or the audience’s experience of that work. Zimmerman - They can network remote locations, manipulate large amounts of information, automate complex processes, and provide very immediate feedback for actions a player takes.

Quick Aside - The “Art” Debate (Apologise for It)

Not interested in this: has been too large a debate, too complex. I’m assuming that what I am talking about is a form of art. Ebert says it isn’t art, Moriarty backs him up. Kellee Santiago’s responses to him.
“countless writers have weighed in on this question” (Zimmerman); the argument has been had elsewhere, and can get very deep, though often it seems to be based on personal opinion. Whether or not it is art is not really an interesting debate here. I don’t have the time or space to get into it. “any work characterized by an obvious aesthetic element is to be deemed a work of art.” I'm not calling the entire medium 'high art' but it is an 'artform'. As Santiago says, they aren’t all art. We don't ask the same of books to say that books are art. Arbitrary in all media, so we just say that they *can be* art.
Recognised in law (Canada, US) and protected as free speech.  &quot;Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.&quot;
It makes no sense to exclude computational media. It is not special in positive or negative way - just another “tool to think with” (Turkle). “Many of us still see the machine as a threat rather than an ally. We cling to books as if we believed that coherent human thought is only possible on bound, numbered pages”. Just an issue of naturalisation (back to this idea of technology).
Perhaps a generic issue, confusing the nature of medium with the products existing in that medium - &quot;cheap, gaudy, violent, unpleasant, degraded pop-culture entertainments for ill-read, ill-mannered little boy brats”. But comic books, film, even novels were considered this way!
Murray - “We often assume that stories told in one medium are intrinsically inferior to those told in another”, “Narrative beauty is independent of medium”, the “real liteary hierarchy is not of medium, but of meaning”.
As this thesis will show intrinsically, computational media are capable of “reflecting reality”, are “performances”, (well-played game), “engage the social reality of the player” (Crowley).
Costikyan -  “a game designer is an artist, working in the medium of games”

What Does ‘Computational Art’ Include?
(NB: Many of these terms are defined by the artists that create them)

Videogames
Not necessarily ‘serious’ Games, but some of them.
Interactive Experiences and ‘notgames’
Interactive Fictions &amp; Certain Cybertexts (if intended as artwork) (aarseth)
Digital Visual Art made with things like Processing (but digitally-represented artwork)
Multimedia Art Installations
Virtual Reality Pieces
Robotics - “We can be talking about robots as well - robots differ from objects only in that their sensors and effectors have physical rather than logical effects.&quot; the creature is kind of a robot.”
Algorithmic Art (such as demoscene stuff)
Some of what Broeckmann calls “machine art”, though not the stuff that is just “art about machines or “art made by machines”, but really “engagement of artists with technical systems”. &quot;no conclusive answer to the question&quot; of what it is.

All of these are computational art, but not all of them use or privilege character and character-led narrative - just part of the definition. We are interested in characters in computational art.
While I will be mainly focussing on what we call ‘videogames’, that term is troublesome, and muddies the debate. Not the only things that are computational art that contain characters, but that is my main literacy.

            <Title>Potential Of Computational Media</Title>
            <Text>Potential Of Computational Art For Creating Characters &amp; Their Narratives

What Is Similar?

Like all artforms, not all computational art is concerned with narrative and character - a lot is though (videogames and interactive fiction most consistently). Ludologists disagree - both sides seeking a Platonic ideal. Eskelinen’s ludicrous comparison to a ball “starts telling stories” - nobody is saying that! - “ &quot;mechanics and story can have an important role to play in a game&quot; - Henry Jenkins’ “not-not-narrative”, Aarseth and Juul against games as stories - Frasca sees it as “simulation vs. Narrative” (2003) - he says it is bunkum. Aarseth sees them as “machines or sign-generators” - I agree, but that does not mean that we are not authoring stories, or that artists do not need to approach it as an exercise in storytelling.

In general, their aim vis-a-vis characters is no different from any other form of art - to create characters of quality, that have resonance - “arrogant” to assume that other artforms aren’t concerned with the same things. Characters which the audience can imaginatively and emotionally connect with and augment themselves, how they “affect us, move us, impact us and make us reflect” (Mullaney). This is not controversial that games do this. 

Computational characters still fit our definition at the start. It is artificially partial (not a complete human being - “an agent is just a set of sentences” (Praxis article), and videogame characters are collections of assets operating in a system, a “set of silicon circuits and unfeeling connectors” (Half-Life Bots) - pursuit of “strong AI” is mostly discredited, making a human, nor is this important to what I am doing). Indeed, the extent or nature of their partiality may be the issue. 

Still individual - with OOO, even more so than in stories because they are modular, rather than serial, or perhaps part of the system still - part of the artwork, but individually recognisable in the way we talked about in last chapter.Can’t necessarily separate the characters from the experience of the game itself - or should we? Must set up the whole experience. Like before, we are not trying to separate characters from their containing work - maybe just saying that they are not a single mode within a story - the story must be viewed from their perspective.

Still represented in a medium, “realises an environment” (Laurel) not that interested in what the medium is - “sensation” (perception) for LeBlanc (Costikyan) and “narrative” - creating a representation - either physical, virtual or in between, like mine. “Presence in game world” - sometimes completely virtual, sometimes involves the real world.

It is perceived and processed by a ‘player’ or ‘user’, who is engaging in a “lusory attitude” (Bernard Suits, other people who talk about this?), “expression”, “masochism” (reception contract), a “fantasy” (LeBlanc), an intentional stance. reader response applies. &quot;. Gaming connects well with this theory because it is such an active event where meaning is creating within a certain contextt between the game and the gamer.&quot; - a 'transaction' (Sanders) - “discovery” is a “game pleasure” - HCI book “partnership” with computer. - “generic user”, or “several specific users” (HCI book) - or “personae” - what terms in QA - “enjoyment”, “emotional response” - “stakeholder” (a term for user” - “reader”, in textual theory

 It has its beginnings in a creative act (an authoring) - by a human designer, at some point (maybe not direct authoring, though) 

They act and behave - indeed, they are ‘agents’ which still, by the same processes described in the last chapter, constitute a narrative, and thus games form narratives themselves (despite ludology (Juul) vs. Narratology debate, S+Z believe games tell narrative, Ryan sees games and literary texts as two different narrative modalities, Espen Aarseth saw them as post-narrative” and Henry Jenkins “not-not-narrative”.

Their narratives, and characters, and the experience of them, as still perceived and judged by particular markers of quality - reviews, thinkpieces - key aim of game authors to create resonant characters. The audience’s role in creating that character is still very important, an interplay of their imaginations and the unique potentials of the game itself. Lankoski’s “allegiance”, judgement and (for lankovski) eliciting sympathy or antipathy based on this. “Recognition”, “alignment”

So computational art shares enough of the same qualities and aims as other narrative artforms to make studying computational character through similar filters worthwhile. But what makes them different, both from other artforms generally and artforms before it specifically? Are there fundamental differences that require a different approach, or certainly a modified approach? Not completely different, and not completely the same. “Though there is much to be learned form traditional narratives… [not] understanding their fundamental differences, the discourse becomes ultimately irrelevant”.

How Different?
Often talk about “unique” potential - a break from previous media. Not necessarily unique (look at last section) but Brendan Keogh calls it “particular” - “maybe all media forms are immersive or interactive in one form or another, and video gams are just immersive and interactive in particular ways” Manovich points out that the potentials of computational media have been seen elsewhere - but more prevalent now, and more focussed.
Unlike old art, is not “hardwired” (Manovich), but “variable”, “movement from object to signal” (Manovich) - is a living system that changes its outputs according to inputs. Not a fixed, diegetic structure. Narrative is not fixed, elements are not fixed; instead, a “framework” (Costikyan) a “space of possibility”, “the aesthetics of interactive systems” (S+Z) Still representational, but those representations (also called “embedded”), Forcier’s “static units” are dealt with ‘procedurally’, combined and processed as units of info in a system of info. ‘Runs’ according to ‘rules’, has “emergence” (S+Z), “flexible and organic” (Zimmerman) - “machines  of  inputs  and  outputs  that  are  inhabited, manipulated,  and  explored.” (Zimmerman). “Procedural” (Bogost) and (Murray)
Different for author - creating a system, a “rule-based formal system” (Juul) - not telling one story - “second-order design” (S+Z). Creating the ‘potential’ for narrative to take place through manipulation or observation of a system. The themes, the potential narratives. “Narrative systems” - &quot;the middle-space between interaction and immersion, where the produral meets the encyclopedic and the participatory meets the spatial, is where narrative resides.&quot; “a game, as it is played, is a collaboration between the developers and the players, a journey of mutual discovery, a democratic artform in which the shape of the game is created by the artist, but the experience of the game is created by the player.” - Costikyan - It's a dispenser of stories, customized to the individual who is playing at the moment.” Will Wright - “overall the narrative is unique to each player and to each play” (Forcier). &quot;game designers create the rigid structures of rules from which play will emerge&quot;. &quot;Traditional media are representational, not simulational.&quot; - not entirely true, but mostly true. So, dealing with procedural simulations in which we have influence and can tell stories rather than merely be given them. - &quot;video games are just a particular way of structuring simulation, just like narrative is a form of structuring representation.&quot; Has rules - &quot;The key trait of simulational media is that it relies on rules: rules that can be manipulated, accepted, rejected, and even contested.” - &quot;symbolic representation&quot; Wexler - Modelling (Klugl and Bazzan) (rules) and simulation (&quot;executing a model&quot;)
How is that narrative created, then? Interactivity - difficult term - through interface - all art is interactive, as the last chapter showed. Also not all interactive, but that interaction is important for the types of computational art that I am interested in. Different for use - usually (but not always, though I am interested mainly in those that are) involves the input and “explicit interaction” (S+Z), interacting with story (Klug) or “direct interaction” (Mullaney), “purposeful interaction” (Costikyan) of a ‘player’ or ‘user’ - “to explore, to make determinations, to take decisive actions, and to follow our choices to their conclusions”. It is ‘operated’ (Bogost), not just experienced vicariously or spectated. “Player control”, “actions are meaningful” (Makai), “interactive decisions” (Koster). “much of their structure is invisible to the user” (Costikyan) - a snapshot on the system - their traversal of it constitutes their narrative - manual, instead of merely ideological or imaginary, interpretation. Have material agency - “the satisfying power to take meaningful action and see the results of our decisions and choices”, a level of “personal, physical involvement that is not possible in more traditional works of fiction.” - “in a world that may be fictional, but that my exercise of will can shape and alter, as though an I, somehow apart from me but feeding perceptions back to me, acts in that world.” (Tavinor). &quot;new media move us from identification to action&quot; (Manovich). Provides feedback loops, “participatory” (Murray). This is what we mean by the “ergodic” in games, even if it isn’t all like that (Newman) - “marriage contract” between user and system (Wegner). Not all computational art needs to be interactive, but very important for most forms - &quot;The evolution of computer technology from the 1970s to the 1990s is expressed by a paradigm shift from algorithms to interaction&quot; (Wegner) or rather a combination of the two. &quot;free movement within a more rigid structure&quot; - I'll stick with that, what we often mean by ‘play’, but ‘play’, again, has difficult affordances - “The simulated reality in the representation becomes procedural, and thus unpredictable, more closely imitating real life. And this procedurality makes it possible to add the most sought-after component of all: the spectator himself as an active element in the work of art.”  - Weiner (1948) - cybernetics, feedback loops, systems (similar to how we interpret books but two-sided) - creating arbitrary rules within systems - not eating meat in minecraft (5/10) as well as performing the designed interactions - interpreting those in different ways - &quot;encouraged affective states&quot; (Keogh) - &quot;We have historically intellectualised videogames as hard configurative systems while downplaying the fact that the reason we really play a videogame is because it feels real good within our soft meaty body. Videogames are a carnal pleasure.&quot; “The field of human-computer interaction largely grew due to this change in interactive pace” - from batch processing to richer interaction. “Communication between user and system” (HCI book) - acting on feedback - “interactive cycle”. A system containing an interface. In recent years increased the “bandwidth of communication” - “goal-seeking behaviour” “in a world of partial knowledge” - “epistemological interaction” (Tavinor, Costikyan) - videogames because “the visual channel is used as the predominant channel for communication”
Relies on the capabilities of the modern, digital computer, (Frasco) - &quot;it is extremely difficult to model complex systems through cogwheels.&quot;) part of the “new media revolution” (Manovich) (Bogost - “cheaper, faster, more capacious, and more connected”) in all its multivariant forms - to compute, to calculate, operate using algorithms and other data manipulation, to manipulate (Weiz - “symbol manipulator”) to store data (”encyclopedic” Murray), to represent everything as numbers which can be manipulated), algorithms, to represent, to sense, “network remote locations, manipulate large amounts of information, automate complex processes, and provide very immediate feedback” (Zimmerman). Interacting with information/data through “a new cultural metalanguage, the interface” - not sure it is new, but certainly particular.
Not necessarily a “unique” potential, as we like to posit (I must be able to find hundreds of references for this assertion - &quot;Traditional storytelling normally deals with endings in a binary way.&quot; - completely disagree). “videogames so often insist separate them from the stodgy changelessness of novels, films, even the plastic arts.” (Bogost) - Remember, other kinds of art use computation, use interactivity, use “scripting” all these things that we are concerned with - “While  every  poem  or  every  song  is  certainly  a  system, games  are  dynamic  systems  in  a  much  more  literal sense.” (Zimmerman) but using modern computer technology allows us to use them at a scale and complexity and a relevance to a wide audience which is certainly unprecedented and which changes the experience (NWF - new media does things that previous media did, but quicker, in parallel, and “at time of audience experience” - “A focus on a new type of storytelling” (Leibowitz and Klug, 2012) . Not all attempt to reach this potential, but I would argue that all are interested in it to some degree - and really we are interested in those that pursue this potential. 
Also cannot be called the ‘best’ or an ‘advance’ on any other form (again, as many people tend to talk about it) - but they are different, with their “own narrative language&quot; (Ryan), and of course their specific methods, techniques and technologies, many of which I have used in my own work. Old ideas combined with new technologies - NWF - &quot;a blossoming of new models of character, story and language&quot;. - and requiring new ways of thinking about the act of authoring, of making art - and of making characters. &quot;we want new media narratives, and we want these narratives to be different from the narratives we have seen or read before.” Tavinor talks about the number of emotions you can feel increasing (guilt, remorse, pride, ashamed, jealous (Brock, 2007). &quot;perhaps there are ways that only games can signify&quot; (Zimmerman) - LeBlancs “taxonomy of game pleasures” (Costikyan) - “fellowship” -Goal-oriented/participatory affects are unique to games - in films, it is &quot;affective mimicry and simulation of the characters&quot;. Rogers, Carpentier and Barnard - interactive media enjoyment comes from degree of control/interactivity/agency.

What Does This Mean For Character And Its Potential Resonance?
For those videogames that are interested in narrative (remember Currie and others from first chapter) characters are very important to such examples of computational art. Their deeds constitute a narrative - and when we are looking at procedural, interactive art, those deeds are controlled and plotted in real-time by the computational and materially interactive power of the computer - meaning that characters, their deeds and the audience’s interactions with them are central to narrative computational art. “Centrality of the AI character to gameplay”, and Ermi and Mayra (2003) and Mallon (2007). It is, technically, what Klugl and Bazzan call &quot;agent-based modelling&quot; - &quot;decision makers&quot; - certain bots - &quot;computer program designed to operate autonomously, performing scheduled, responsive, or real-time operations in a computer, through the Internet, and/or on social media networks. What distinguishes bots from other kinds of software is that they interact with and/or produce content for humans, often assuming a human persona.&quot;
Caveats - Will be mainly looking at videogame characters as examples of computational artistic characters, but my methodology also takes into account other examples and disciplines which share many of these methodological challenges (see my bibliography). I do not mean to just privilege videogames characters, but it is my research background and focus, and while I may not call Project knole a “game”, this does not mean that it does not share most of its attributes with videogames - it just means that the term “game” is a troublesome one, no matter what it is attached to. 
Also focussing on NPCs - characters in the gameworld, “intelligent agents”, “autonomous agents” “embodied conversational agents” . Project knole is not about the player controlling a character - it is about them directly interacting with the masterbeast - what we would call a non-player character. Of course, will see that this is a difficult distinction in my method - talk about the player perhaps choosing to identify with the character that Anne describes at the beginning of the Housekeeping, but do not have to - not prescriptive, the role is very bare, can decide for themselves (pathos) whether or not the creature has been left since the 18th century, and the actions of other players confuses it too - are they people who have received the pamphlet as well, due to the printer’s deceit? - though also not interested in characters and other people, as in multiplayer (cite?) or ‘bots’ (Believable bots, other bot papers) - but the focus are on the “other” characters. Of course, lots of game character scholarship is about the PC (Lankoski 2011, Lange, Theatre &amp; Games chap, Tanenbaum &amp; Bizzochi) - “Player-character bond is often seen as one of the most important aspects of game storytelling.” This is an issue which is not vital to my work, and introduces concepts which are distinct from an audience’s experience, interaction, judgement and evaluation of NPCs - such as “vehicular embodiment” (Newman) - though many of the concepts talked about below have been written about in terms of NPCs, and are the ones which I have deemed to be applicable to NPCs as well - we still ‘control’ NPCs through our interactions, though it may be indirect. (cite?). &quot;conceptually problematic&quot; to focus on the PC. Tension between personality and control.
So, what is the potential of computational character? In general, same as any other character - to be ‘resonant’. As said before, in general this means positive judgement, within the percepts of the medium, by an audience, and achieved by a combination (and in between) the representation itself and the imaginative extrapolation of the audience. This is no different for a game character, though the nature of that combination, and the representation, and what it does to the imagination, is different (or “particular”, remember) from other types of narrative artforms. Wexler points out games like Pong saw the actual rise of procedural and computational character, rather than merely represented computationally, like a digital photograph.
Computational characters have the potential to achieve their resonance through being computational. Not to be static artefacts, but to be part of a real-time computation, to change and adapt according to the rules of the system and the inputs of the player and other factors - to not have their stories told, but for their actions to depend on many factors decided at run-time. To have ‘agency’, and to be ‘agents’, “autonomous” - just like the player, to “support the interactive experience of playing the game”
Of course, many game characters are not, explicitly, computational or procedural in any major way, even if part of something computed - (examples) - use the static techniques of other media, or restrict their computability (because of challenges, as seen in next section) - there is nothing wrong with this, nor do I see a truly “computational” character as intrinsically better - but this potential is one that is intrinsic to the media and techniques used, and has a promise of a fundamentally different experience of fictional beings.
What is unique promise? “Engaging narratives with life-like characters” “INTERESTING PEOPLE… IN INTERESTING PLACES… DOING INTERESTING THINGS”, “improved realism” (Harris &amp; Gittens 2015) a “hypothetical future [in which] players could interact with computerized characters as round as those in novels or films, making choices that would influence an ever-evolving plot.&quot; (Bogost) - return to his cynicism later. “more specific and interesting personalities&quot;, form “significant relationships” (Ueda) (significant in ‘magic circle’, or outside it) and thus provide the agency for “strong narrative interactive experiences” (Elizabeth talk). The interactivity of character (Sanocki), to intervene (Life Is Strange lady). &quot;creating relationships between the players and the characters in the game&quot;, &quot;compelling, memorable characters&quot;. “Players of modern video games increasingly expect Artificial Intelligence that is dynamic, is able to react to unexpected events, and behaves believably&quot; “dynamic and unpredictable”.
Measures of this promise: believability. Loyall provided best definition. Togelius talks about it as well. “Life-like in appearance and behaviour, with a clearly defined personality and distinct emotional state, is driven by internal goals and beliefs, consistent in its behaviour, is capable of interacting with its environment and other participants, is aware of its surroundings and capable of changing its behaviour over time.” Not necessarily “realistic” (Mateas) but “socially situated, and able to reason in social terms” (Bailey) - - &quot;convincingness and trustworthiness&quot; - fogg and tseng, bartneck in Weiss and Tscheliegi - Reidl &amp; Stern 2006 - more like real people, “more humanlike” (Johansson and Verhagen) in that they are materially simulated, mimetic, less diegetic. ”illusion of life” (look at all the other models as well) To have “self-awareness, intentional states and self-impelled actions, to express emotions, the ability to use natural language and persistent traits”, reactivity, interactivity, - “manifest believable behaviour” - &quot;plausible, malleable and loveable&quot; - Evans - ““Autonomy” not very different from most characters, but now has to be part of a system - all possible states that that character must be in - less control, ‘second-order design’ and now is responsive to unpredictable or systemic input, which must be wide to be realistic. &quot;Reciprocity&quot; - Gouldner (in W&amp;T) saying that this is &quot;a pattern of social exchange&quot; - not parasocial anymore. A move from parasocial to social relationships. Believability creates “engagement” “emotion, personality, self-motivation” (Lankovski)., also providing a “possibility for a deeper interaction between players and NPC”, “co-presence” (Bevalacqua) Bevacqua et al - &quot;coupling&quot; in virtual agents - the continuous mutual affect between two individuals - believability, co-presence (&quot;being-with&quot;) and engagement - “Interactivity also helps them form, a close bond wit hthe characters much more easily than in print or film” - is this borne out by research? Is it a unique potential, or just the same goals but particular to this media? As Bogdanovych points out, belivability comes from non-interactive animation. So interactivity is important, but really it is computation - the real-time procedure of demonstrating a character, more like a real person - that is important.
 Approaches - will discuss some, but AI “holds the most promise of change” (Castronova), but is a holistic part of game design, as characters are tied to game system in many ways. Lankski and Bjork (2007) - &quot;character design related to gameplay&quot; - also mechanics in general, (nucle.ai’s point that AI is everything in game, dispersed model), “game feel” (swink) - sound design, visual design, a holistic process. 
End with an example of a ‘good’ game character. Elizabeth? Came highest in “embodied conversational agent”. This is what I want for my character - to be dynamic, computational, and for that to lead to resonance - an artistic quality inherent, and not in spite of or in the absence of, the affordances of the medium that I choose to work in. To explore the potential of the medium, not to shrink from it. Characters in games are inextricable from the wider potential of games. “We’re just scratching the surface of what games are and what they can be” (Alderman). Moving on from Murray’s “incunabular days”. “Beyond… compelling entertainment to attain the force and originality that we associate with art?” - “we do not yet fully know what computational can do and do not yet fully understand the expressive capacities of [computational art]”Bartle - &quot;If virtual worlds could be populated by intelligent NPCs, all manner of doors would open&quot;. Do all characters need to be this ‘believable’? What about ‘bit’ characters? Well, to a lesser extent, but we aren’t really focussing on ‘bit’ characters. Point out that not all characters are trying to be believbale - I am focussing on those that are, or which need to be.</Text>

            <Title>Problems Of Characterisation In Computational Media</Title>
            <Text>Despite this potential, and these apparent paragons of “resonant” characterisation in computational arts, there are MANY PROBLEMS with these approaches, and distinct and ‘particular’ CHALLENGES to creating such characters. The challenge itself? “Generating a character through simple algorithms and then trying to make it rounded and real enough to generate emotions is one of the big challenges in modern computing”, a “hypothetical future [in which] players could interact with computerized characters as round as those in novels or films, making choices that would influence an ever-evolving plot.&quot; (Bogost). Interactive storytelling “largely failed to deliver on its promises over its forty-year history.”

Naomi Alderman - “I can’t begin to tell you how hard it is to write good characters in games”.
Have we really moved beyond the ‘juvenilia’ stage, the ‘incunabular days’ of Murray’s prediction? In terms of representing beings in a way that fulfils the potential of the medium, no. 
This is just an overview of the problems, many of which are implicit in Project knole’s narrative.
Things are better, but we are still at a point where we can seriously have to ask for a “believable character as opposed to a believable gun” at a major AI conference (2013)
 &quot;haven't progressed that much&quot;
Samyn (Almost Art) - &quot;t in terms of cultural relevance, social importance and aesthetic impact, videogames still play second fiddle to cinema, literature or music, because underneath their superficial artistic appearance, videogames are bland, unforgiving, meaningless, cold-blooded, rigid systems.&quot;
Frank Lantz in RoP - despite the breathtaking pace of recent technical and commercial advancement, games have remained creatively stunted.
“In the mainstream space I really haven’t seen a whole lot of progress.”
In computational art, particularly in the form of videogames, there are many characters that do not fulfil the quality of 'resonance'. Indeed, it seems that there is something inherent to the artform that makes achieving 'resonance' especially difficult, particularly in balancing artistic nuance with the design demands of the dynamic system, and characters as elements within that system. How the potentials introduced in previous section are part of the challenges.
&quot;Video games don’t have a great record with relationships&quot;



—————————————————————————————————————
This is just an overview of the problems, many of which are implicit in Project knole’s narrative.

How The Potentials Create The Challenges

A Mechanical System Can Produce Systematised, Mechanical Characters - The problem of representing people as discrete information, and then asking people to reconstitute them through play and interpretation. Digitising the analogue. This is where the ludology/narratology debate breaks down. This is why a ‘believable gun’ is easier. Very ‘nodal’, just elements of a system. Game designers often say to avoid subtlety (Halo). NPCS “spawn to act as props”. &quot;they train their players to ignore the fiction that wraps the patterns&quot;. 
Critiques bioshock for being heavy-handed and systematic. &quot;extremes of human behaviour&quot;
&quot; the game’s supposed moral calculus&quot;
&quot;Games lend themselves well to ambiguity&quot; - well, you wouldn't think it, looking at modern game design.
&quot;difficult task of combining variability with narrativity&quot; 
Points out that the mini-game is very systematic and mechanical - can be chunked.
Reputation systems - very rough-grained. &quot;don't typically maintain individual opinions&quot;
Warns against designers creating closed puzzles, discrete systems that are neat engineering feats, but allow no room for the human mind for the computation and solution
With Fable and Black &amp; White, the whole point was to separate the &quot;moral&quot; aspects from the reward structure, so that the primary game mechanics never drive you towards good or evil. It used purely emotional cues (e.g. a sad face and a whimper on your 60-foot pet tiger) to engage players on &quot;moral&quot; decisions - hence, empathy
&quot;something left untouched&quot; when you don't mix story and game.
Even in ostensibly story-driven games, characters become clothing dolls, sex objects, marriageable.
 Tavinor points to &quot;fracture&quot; between story/context and action in game (killing in uncharted). considered Elizabeth as mute.
 A character may have this combination well, but the primary activity of the game is so detached from them that they don't pay attention to them. 
mismatch between core of game (the ludemes) and the dressing can result i nserious problems for user experience - ludonarrative dissonance.
No words must design (p10) - all games “has some degree of puzzle solving” - well, autocosmics is puzzle-solving in all its forms. “You can’t extract puzzle from game entirely”
 Companions still named one of he worst things about videogame (Guardian). 
Quests one of these problems as well. when characters previously individualised (in cutscenes, dialogue) become slave to the mechanics of the game world and come up wanting. The mechanics take over, the character is just a cipher. YOu don’t care about them or feel sympathy - unhelpful. Control has been taken away from us. Vocalisations are annoying. AI does not behave in a realistic, varied and coherent behaviour&quot;

Halo talking about players not understanding behaviour - often because behaviour/expectation was v. mechanical.
Use of the word &quot;bark&quot; by a lot of developers is telling - just animals.
Weizenbaums “mechanical parody” widespread in computer science and programming.
if story is not strong, or not integrated with action, or the action is not strong, you have a dissonance.
If the character does not react emotionally to events, if they don?t care? then neither will we. The emotionless character is lifeless? as a machine?”
Dissonance of character.
&quot;scoring&quot; is instrumentalisation and mechanicalisation. Not necessarily a problem, however. Scores don't have to be so mechanical (Clark)
tears flowing down cheeks, and facial animations, &quot;is no guarantee that the story was meaninful to its viewers&quot; - not just representational, the meaning MUST come from the simulation as well.
games are &quot;readily absorbed&quot;, which is part of their problem.
Harrison’s ‘reduction to utility’.
A+C - Story &quot;divorced from the system&quot; is a &quot;luittle troublesome&quot;
The “formality gap” - between the real-world-as-system and a formal constructed system
videogames are bland, unforgiving, meaningless, cold-blooded, rigid systems.&quot;
Dan Klein - what is important is the “utility” of AI - what they do, not how they think.
 By interfacing with a new media, &quot;three-dimensional space becomes surface... a character becomes an icon... what at one moment was a ficitonal universe becomes a set of buttons that demand action&quot; 
The primary activity of a book is &quot;watching people do things
Searle - programs are syntactic, not semantic - the nature of the information does not matter.
Romance subplots - “vending machines [from which] sex falls out” (Hernandez), don’t preserve “weird and complicated” nature of human beings. Often seen as essentialised for gameplay, which means that they are mechanical and never as good as in other artforms. Lanskovski and Bjork state that with mechanical NPCs we take Dennett’s physical stance, rather than his intentional stance - we see them as tools.‘creature loses a lot of his charm the more you train him because he is focused (becomes useful, but robotic)’ - Amanda Yaklin AI becomes predictable once it is ‘trained’.

He says ghames shoudl not be limited by being an inherently mathematical medium - compares to music.
Makes a distinction between &quot;disliking&quot; and &quot;tooling&quot; characters. If still seen as social other, rather than being based on how &quot;useful&quot; they are.
”visual intelligence” - if they don’t see it, it doesn’t happen. Make it big and clunky animations in most games Need to be able to tell what they are thinking and why they do things.”
cliche characters help you work out who they are - helping you chunk them! Their role in the world. Depends how tied to mechanics they are.
“So used to not caring” about the characters.
identify &quot;anti-heuristics&quot; for believability - lack of adaptation, lack of awareness/over-awareness, low or bad models of others, low or bad model of self. 
“general AI routines in the game engine”
hostility/friendliness - &quot;I&quot; oriented, rather than identification/empathy only, as in books. More useful = less liked, which is interesting - not a tool
&quot;Standardisation of a deeper level&quot; - characters become templates of technique. 
Evans states that agents provoke simple, more polar reactions. Maybe this is the problem. Maybe we need to move away from agents as components in a system. 
“toolchain” &quot;one file among numerous others on our hard drives&quot; “merely abstract symb ols of action?” 
Lots of games about combat (good system to replicate) and characters are very small in characterisation. “Barks” or “combat dialogue” used for “flavor only”.
&quot;convincing psychological agency&quot; - we don't have it, game in its systems needs to make us feel like we are interacting with real people, or realish people. 
Oblivion characters - limited interactions with them, no consistency/change in modelling or the characters over time (scars are often the conflict-based cliche of this idea)
“Because the effort involved in content creation is so great, the content creation process also needs to be standardised” 
What is abstracted, and what is detailed? Often ‘simpler’ things, like guns, are made detailed (receiver game) rather than the more complex things, or those things for which we do not have paradigms.
Just focussing on ‘believable behaviours’ - but still within the paradigm of system, not paradigm of the character itself. What about the inner life? If somebody comes up against that, it shatters. Work on Claudette - Just acts - acting at eating and drinking, no goals or intent. Even with goal, how deep do you go?
Autocosmics is a specturm - for him, psychological engagement and information access compete.. &quot;between action and representation&quot;. Games have both. How can we make them compete less? How does this relate to character?
Serve system or character? &quot;It is dramatically depicted ambivalence rather than efficient goal selection that makes a sequence of events into a story.&quot;
Bogost - Bioshock “posed as a serious, hard science fiction take-down of the doomed hubris of technophilic selfishness, but in truth the game was just a spruced-up first-person shooter”
a major barrier to the exploration of emotional resonance in games is the puzzle-solving orientation, in which all game objects and actors are reduced to the status of things to be used in order to achieve an end.
 &quot;characters in computer games have expertise in some well-defined but narrow area&quot; “Artificial intelligence has done well in tightly constrained domains.” They have to be, we aren’t trying to build people, but need to fit into world betyt

Newman - “They are equipment to be utilised in the gameworld by the player”
&quot;must have dignity&quot; - for Gard, this means not objectifying the character.
Game Designer summit - must respect the characters to get people to treat them properly - this can conflict with gamelay.
&quot;treat them more as appliances than as people&quot;
In games - even “individual” AIs must be part of a system (and, unlike grammar/language, that system must run on a very limited machine)
Siboot - “near-constant motion” of face - but most of face doesn’t move still ritualistic symbol manipulation, not naturalistic at all.
James Andrews and Loren Schmidt Realistic Kissing Simulator (2014) lampoons the mechanistic, twitch, manual approach to human contact that it sometimes seems that games are capable of making. Can lick the other person’s eye - they close it in response - or their nose - the ridiculousness of this simulation.
Using archetypes- works well with systemics.
Making characters believable - “acts in unrealistic way”
P90 - talks about ludonarrative dissonance. Can happen with PCs or NPCs.
“Need to speak and act in realistic and believable ways in order for the player to form a close bond with them”

“We are highly sensitive to variations and intonation in speech, and are therefore intolerant of imperfections in synthesized speech” - “non-prosodic tones” - this is changing, however!
&quot;rules-governed worlds&quot; - all fictional worlds are rules-governed - the difference is how and when they break!
 &quot;how difficult it is to get an AI to walk through a door properly&quot; (Bioshock talk).
 &quot;maintain that illusion of life&quot; is much harder. It's hard enoguh to make a character just look like a person, let alone the emotional content. &quot;bad animation, bad contextual reactions, bad pathfinding.&quot; Smoothness is what is missing in games - the transition between elements being so complex, they judder into one another. 
The reasonwhy we make this choice is because characters have oftena major role in the believability of book and movie stories. However, unlike book and movie characters, agents should be able to cope with a wide range of possible situations without anyone to tell them what to do.
“A simple “normal” reaction to an event, a reaction that every human would understand, can be difficult for a computer to achieve. The challenge lies in replicating these very crucial behaviors that are such a big part of human behavior that they cannot be omitted or the believability is lost.”
Waypoint (vice) talks about why character is so difficult - what must be built - the representation is so hard - The reason we cannot do characters in AI is because AI finds ordinary human things very difficult to do - and ordinary relatable behaviour is what we crave in characters - “the literary”.
There is no silver bullet for specifying complex systems is a consequence of the irreducibility of interactive systems to algorithms.&quot;
If you want unique, complex circumstances to arise, it’s hard to create something more consistently unpredictable than what happens when you throw two or more people together.
Reference the issues with memory and performance comapred with other media.
SO many little things that are not thought of i.e. &quot;active feedback&quot;
The ‘emergent’ creates many different problems.Makes point that even bad films have human beings acting, and which we respond to instinctively. Ken 
&quot;simply frozen in time, repeating the same actions&quot;
the social interactions &quot;are not meaningful&quot;
A Complex System In Constant Motion Can Produce Glitches &amp; Problems Of Believability - in other words, “looking broken”. Claudette - Emotions not fired in the right context (no facial animations is a problem, then). Doesn't react appropriately to asking topics again and again. Not aware of context at all. No new goals if goals are met - just ticking them off. Players tryng to divine her character from the rules (i.e. around stolen goods) but not consistent enough.
“The intelligent behavior these characters show to the player is often flawed… little or no emotional impact.” “Changes alignment suddenly. Initially, players put these things down to bugs or quirks” (Tence And Buche).
&quot;rudimentary actions with characters&quot;
Ask Gavin about how much actual mechanical difference there is? Replayablity ends up exposing it. People want to find the whole system, understand its breadth
Therefore often aim for “predictability” - Aiming for &quot;predictability&quot; rather than intelligence. Not how chars are - the narrative is the end result of their (imagined) free movement within a system. Makes the interesting point that we must build purposefully-flawed artificial intelligences to create believable autonomous characters.
“we often encounter the troublesome case of characters in one area of the game world appearing cognizant of the player’s behavior in another area before word of it could have ever spread to them.”
Action selection is a hard problem (bryson).
Problems with the Sims - “ They were simulations of people, but there was a lot missing.” - doing weird things because the system could not handle the human social realm in simulation.
If “reception contract” is broken, we experience “narrative resistance”. A lack of consistency, of coherence truth - operating between the game and the world.
The Way The Audience Interacts With The Artwork - Chunking and grokking. &quot;mastering a game requires understanding it as a system; reducing all components in the game so they can be understood by taking the physical stance towards them, or habit-forming.&quot; Uncertainty, seen as a problem, so avoided. “instrumental agency” of player (Laurel), to “get under the hood” - chunking the gamespace (related to predictability).
Empowering the user can lead to aesthetically unsatisfying outcomes, but restricting her through constraints from the plot can limit engagement.
Players trying to find optimal path - cheating, riding rough-shod over the world. Koster compares it to the Gordian Knot
“The conflict between aesthetics and utility.”
. Players' sensitivity to the repetition of environments and of game scenarios/events/characters is also a sign of their desire for a game world that feels real and alive. (Forcier) 
Personalities are often &quot;replicated&quot;
&quot;NPCs (Non Player Characters) in the game
are not that complex or smart. They will start acting

How did my testees interact with characters.

Points out experience of player makes things more difficult for believability - systematising.
is suspension of disbelief/immersion in direct competition with this systematising tendency.

Ppl have chunked this simplicity - they are not expecting to have a socially-good experience and it becomes not a social simulator but a way of negotiating state machines.
S+Z say all games have intrinsic friction between proscriptive rules and free play. 
Computers combine immersive illusion and “virtual instrument panel” - what does this do to characters? Info vs. Immersion.
Assumed centrality of player (Game Narrative Book) - don’t let them get bored, or think they aren’t important. This makes all characters subservient to the player’s current wonts. This is not the only interpretation of agency - a move away from this now, to ‘living worlds’ of which the player is a part, rather than ‘control panel worlds’. &quot;As we learn more patterns, more novelty is needed to make a game attractive... in that sense, games are disposable, and boredom is inevitable&quot;. Without believable behaviours, players perceive machine patterns, not good patterns - the &quot;proverbial clockwork&quot; - &quot;learns [the game's] hideen logic. p. 223 - reducing to algorithms and data structures.&quot;
Dealing with Ameixa et al - &quot;out-of-domain input&quot;
“these players are angry because they feel they’ve been offered freedom but have found their options constrained by a worldview unlike their own.”
Patrick Wilson (week 2) - when we understand how something works, the intelligence vanishes.
Part of the fun is trying to catch AI out. Maybe the ‘lusory attitude’ is the problem.
Again, all this relates to the problem of the word ‘game’ - can a ‘game’ ever expand how it deals with character resonantly?
The market - “Gamer culture is a cultivated, enthusiast, techno-determinist culture.” (Keogh) - being utopian, demanding games be everything.
“Considerable debate as to whether giving the player more control leads to better and more enjoyable stories”
We are subconsciously tuned to how things are supposed to work at a cognitive level
ence and Buche, # of interactions need to be high for believability but high risk of repetition
A Lack Of Diversity In Approach Due To Paradigms - Even when characters are “resonant” within their genres, the genres that we have are not very character-focussed, and there is little appetite for expansion apart from on the fringes. Characterisation revealed through actions is done a lot. The problem with games, then, is that they don't sit still to make character long enough to make character the centre of the action.
the things they &quot;most often simulate&quot; (italics theirs s+z)
Plots in these sorts of games are often very big, not about one-to-one interaction - therefore, yes subtlety and nuance are a problem, as is good characterisation. Character interaction is not a big part of these games, and investigating them is not in the ‘pace’ of the game. So, are we trying to do too much, situating them in such a big world.
soft chambers is interested in what verbs we use - the verbs that we don't use (caring/nurturing/growing/giving/embracing/resting) are &quot;devalued activities under capitalism, they are considered feminized actions or are excluded from the category of 'action' entirely&quot;
Also, a vicious cycle - NPCs worse, so focussed on less/not up close in game stories because the cracks will show. &quot;most of the time they go unnoticed, sitting on the periphery, regurgitating the same three Lines&quot; or just rely on motion theory - too far the other way - &quot;game over state doesn't make sense in a narrative sense&quot; - it can do! &quot;recreate the cinematic in a game&quot; (amy hennig visceral games) - “Cinematic evolution of game stories” (klug)
&quot;stunning representational advances”
&quot;story has become something of an afterthought in the design of many games&quot;
&quot;wrap a story&quot; around the game.
Constrained because of the algorithms we have, and the algorithms we have are decided by certain genres.
Use of randomness (Bailey) - use of defaults - doesn’t work (stochastics)
Focus on certain things in games - graphics (Millington and Funge), compulsive mechanics, combat AI, environment development replayability (GLFAI 13), over the pursuit of ‘believable NPCs’ (Millington and Funge point this out). Just look at differences between Oblivion and Skyrim. “The difference between the realistic graphics and the rather flawed AI is often all too evident to players of computer games”. Cerny et al - &quot; unprecedented level of graphical fidelity to the real world&quot; More work on this in the academic AI sector (examples in Zotero) but lack of talk between academic AI and game AI - general feeling that games need to ‘work’ and so rigourous pursuit of such solutions are not cost-effective. Focus on certain representational techniques (realistic faces (Ruttkay and Wilson), procedural facial expressions, procedural body posture, personality modelling, gaze control, emotion simulation, physiology simulation (mostly in academia, though). “replay value&quot; is often a big thing - tied to profits, increase instrumentality of a character. &quot;more realistic gestures and facial expressions&quot; - all part of the problem, but avoiding the ‘fuzzier’ issues. Hancock ‘16 -sophisticated graphic-based representations are often employed as a yardstick for technological superiority, as it is a form of advancement that can be discerned by the naked eye. &quot;all I can do is hurt people&quot; (Paste Article)
Challenge, quantifiable outcome. Games have commonly triggered flight autocosmics, or exploratory autocosmics, rather than social autocosmics.
&quot;combat AI is often the largest AI subsystem&quot; divided into combat and non-combat AI. Eveything that isn't fighting is bundled together!
All art has conflict, but not all art has competition.
Henry Jenkins - &quot;the application of film theory togames can seem heavy-handed and literal-minded&quot;
Turkle states that movement is not always necessary anymore - how we are confront by psychological objects. “Motion theory” is not enough anymore. “Movement is not the key to the puzzle”
Blunt tools - reputation systems, faction systems, “simple flags” (Wardrip-Fruin 2009). (ryan and somerville)
Games are more interested in better AI for the genres we have (game designer talk)
Focus on graphics - pursuit of ‘realism’ misplaced. &quot;fundamentally incomplete [realism], full of gaps and white spots&quot;. Better tech achieves a &quot;stronger reality effect&quot;. Just focussing on database. &quot;who determines what will be filled and what will remain a gap in the simulated world?&quot;
Cutscenes as a solution - Unskippable cut scenes &quot;contravenes our basic human rights&quot;. &quot;establishing the fictive world&quot; &quot;directly support narrative play on many levels&quot; Cutscenes can function as rewards, but maybe they are used for the wrong things.
As Mullaney points out, often the culture itself participates in self-neoteny, sticking to unhelpful distribution methods and deliberately avouiding artistic debate by framing themselves as entertainment, detached from the issues of real life (Mullaney, Smuts). this idea of ‘crying at games’, which persists. “awkward system of emotional currency that equates tears with sentimental aptitude, but fails to acknowledge…” - (Year in feels). Emotions in games - Cover displays a classic sexist sci-fi action scenario - not necessarily bad, but shows the base-line. &quot;maximise the gamer's entertainment pleasure&quot;
&quot;design templates&quot; and &quot;conventions&quot; are a financial necessity.
It’s all about keeping people for engaged as long as possible.
&quot;There simply is no place for art in such a tight schedule.&quot;
Talking about “Mass Effect 17”
Making the player cry - such a stupid - “creating a story that can make the majority of its audience cry is a mark of good writing and character design” - but he does point out that its not needed.

Manovich - today’s digital designers and artists use only a small set of action grammars… out of a much larger set of possibilities”
&quot;What other kinds of conflict can games simulate?&quot; (social conflict, psychological conflict, interpersonal conflict) - &quot;truly tough design challenges&quot; &quot;may take generations to develop&quot;. Zunshine (2006) says that fiction is about theory-of-mind, which we are good at. Are games about theory-of-mind, then? Partly, but not really - we rarely have to deal with unpredictable minds other than in basic &quot;intentional stance&quot; ways. &quot;A lot of the same stories are being told right now&quot; (Campo Santo). Call them &quot;opponents&quot; rather than people - telling. (warpefelt and straat).factions and other group behaviours mean that very simple systems can make ecological sense, because factions react in the same way, and provides a higher degree of intentionality.

“winning&quot; and &quot;losing&quot; makes it difficult to characterise. A slave to the system.
Cycles of &quot;reward&quot; and &quot;punishment&quot; - often punishment is just &quot;losing&quot; or getting rid of progress - this is not how person-to-person interaction works. &quot;repetition&quot; - breaks the narrative flow.
Replayability comes from the need to &quot;feel out the countours of [the] system&quot;.
Things becoming &quot;rote&quot; or chunked in games. &quot;grinding&quot; grinding takes time, not skill or understanding. 
Ai in modern games addresses movement, decision makings, and tactical decision making - these are still important, but limited.
Frasco - &quot;the knowledge and interpretation of simulations requires repetition.&quot; - true, but maybe our chars don't stand up to repetition, or maybe this changes our relationship with them fundamentally. It depends on why you are coming to the simulation.
In other words, the binary logic found in ludus stands out when delivering
games set in fairy-tale-like environments, where things are generally black or
white. When you move onto other topics such as human relationships,
suddenly distinctions are not so clear-cut. Only paidia, with its fuzzier logic
and its scope beyond winners and losers, can provide an environment for
games to grow in their scope and artistry.&quot;

Intereing - Oatley talks about the lack of imagination needed in thrillers or theme park rides - you are the same person when you get off at the other end. - “mount[ing] a vehicle” or “package vacation” - “one can have ana bsorbing time, but such experiences can be meager of agency”
&quot;guildlike model of apprenticeship&quot; for game designers. No crazy auteurs, tend to do what they have seen work.
“Many people in the game industry have a tendency to think that there’s a best way to do everything” - story as technical problem.
&quot;flow&quot; is what we look for in games - &quot;mihaly czikznemihyali&quot; - from feedback, having goals, change over time. These are not inimicable to character. Depends what the verbs are, what feels like failure. What would a &quot;flow&quot; of character look like? Can be difficult without being &quot;flowing&quot; or &quot;fun&quot;
Soft Chambers as a response to this.Compulsion architectures in games - have become so naturalised that we feel ‘cheated’ if a game does not have replayable ‘content’, even if that content is crappy!
consider, for instance, the ways in which caring and communication have typically been rendered in digital games: as predictable, solvable problems
A system does not lend itself to tradfitional narratives or characters -more nodel, less living. Therefore we make them less dynamic. Either more nodal or less systemic.
 The game-master bases NPC output on a highly sophisticated interactive algorithm synthesizing years of social observation and literary convention: the human mind. To even begin to compete, the computer-game author must effectively write this algorithm from scratch; an impossible task, even for the artificial-intelligence experts!

“We suspect that the goal-oriented and rules-based nature of games may stand in the way of artistic expressiveness.”
They are very simple - or just animals.
Frude points out that the intimate machine market has not really grown yet.
Architecture of a computer system leads to a certain sort of character - they tend to be less character-driven
An alternative to the graphic-dominated history of videogames is a variantological approach, in which marginalized and past forms of representation are not seen as dead ends and failures, but as variants that offer alternative perspectives.

Attempts To ‘Solve’ Or Improve Characterisation In Computational Art (Both Good &amp; Bad)



Typical Solutions - Sticking to &quot;games model&quot;, seeing NPCs as NODAL, characterisation separate from play/system,existing techniques (dialogue engines, traditional characterisation), games with justifiably limited charactesrr, ignore problem entirely.

Technological Advances - Improving the medium itself. Toby Gard - “steady technological progress has slowly opened up possibilities for more believable and realistic characters”. &quot; most videogame fans are sold on the idea that the history of games is a history of technology&quot; Say that graphical updates needed for &quot;illusion of immersion and interaction with surroundings, materials and substances&quot; - not sure this is true!
This is going to be an endless race towards better techniques for rendering better characters and allowing them to compute. Most of these advances have been in the field of AI - machine learning (Tence and Buche), neural networks, (other recent advances?), but also affective gaming (Christy and Kuncheva) (2014), graphics representation (p243 Manovich), from abstract in 60s/70s to improved tech now, more representational. AI developers (AI Summit) speak of “technological stagnation” in their field, and the need for better technology. Togelius (and others (Millington and Funge)) speak about the need to unite the findings of academic AI and game AI. “games are so tightly coupled to consumer electronics that technical progress outstrips aestehtic progress in the public imagination.” Weiz thinks that programmers believe computers can “do anything, problems can be reduced and reduced” - is character a problem to reduce. Learning - “Extending the reach of the designer into unknown” (Russell &amp; Norvig) - not against this at all. - “often used when creating believable virtual characters in games or in other types of virtual environments”. Russell &amp; Norvig - “the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions”. 3d animation that once would stun an audience with it's realism now barely has any effect, or looks wrong and out of place.

Not sure how I feel about that. - I don't think this will fundamentally change our relationship with characters - it isn't where the problem is. - &quot;whole new medium&quot;, not a step.

“Learning is not as widely used as you might think”
Learning leads to “unpredictability” therefore “severly curb… the learning ability of game characters”Bryson - ai and moral agents - “exaggerated fears and hopes” - actually all AI promises us the same as any human artefact. Computers are just a tool. 
 However, what must be pointed out is that advances in the fields of AI come not just from technological improvement, but improvements of understanding of psychology, how natural systems work, and how to emulate natural processes (e.g. BOD). Also, a focus on technology smacks of utopianism and “technological fetishism”; the “prevalent idea” in the industry that more complex = better characters, and that that complexity comes from technology or implementation. (egs of games recently that have touted complex AI?) The focus on “general-purpose AI”, or “strong AI” (that bosses such as Insomniac guy from video think are coming, “respond to everything you say”) and the tweet about the misunderstanding amongst game bosses about the truth of the difficulty of AI. Look back at Herbert Simon’s overzealous predictions in 1957, and the fortunes of the AI industry. The quest for the “synthetic person” - misunderstands what a character is. It must be partial. However, we have been making the wrong things partial. People expect too much from technology - expect fully fledged people. &quot;it is difficult to create an artificial character that convinces a real person for more than a few minutes&quot; - maybe we need to avoid this. This focus on believability - Really, then, this is resonance - believability is too limited a term. Tence &amp; Buche see ‘believability’ as ‘acting like a human’ - not always the case - I am not looking at their definition of ‘believability’, really. Generally, what we mean by believability is the consistency of the behaviors of the character, i.e. that the decisions the character takes are understood by the viewer. Believability, the way it is defined in this thesis, concerns itself with how natural the behavior of a character is, how far the actions of the character agree with what the player believes should happen in such a context. “Is it (strong AI) necessary or even desirabele for practical benefits?” Goodwinds. Newman - experience of playing games is kinaesthetic, not visual - about how it works as a system - autocosmics, rather than representational. How things sit in a systems.”This idea is in direct opposition to all current trends in animation, which take the route of desperately trying to look real, usually by realistic lighting and rendering, or by forcing a hand-made or naive appearance. At the time of writing, this trend shows no apparent signs of ceasing” - too big a sphere. Prom Week - “social simulation game” - “make social interactions truly playable”. Emergent, systemic approaches to social situations just like in other games (use Angry Birds physics engine as example). “5,000 rules of social norms and behaviours” - not a sustainable way to do it. Role is now “aggressive machine learning (rather than hand-encoding of knowledge” “Game AI development is a mixture of techniques and infrastructure with aa generous dose of ad hoc solutions, heuristics and bits of code that look like hacks” Learning - “hot topic” in games. Has “the potential to produce more believable characters”
&quot;fundamentally incomplete [realism], full of gaps and white spots&quot;
 Better tech achieves a &quot;stronger reality effect&quot;. Just focussing on database. &quot;who determines what will be filled and what will remain a gap in the simulated world?&quot;
 Will technological advances have a ceiling? How far can we go? The end of Moore’s law, processor density etc. We still have problems, especially with many technologies surrounding character-to-character interaction such as speech (Gris et al, Newell and Edwards 2008) - and when do we decide that we have “solved” these problems? As Mullaney points out (drawing on the work of Lewis Jacobs), film became art when it moved past “scientific curiosity to a creative enterprise” - focussing on subject matter, using the tools we have. Games are computational in their uniqueness. Their graphics are not what define them. How they computer is important. New technology has not made films better, has it? OK, it is a traditional narrative technique, but still… NWF points out that realism does not give us more authorial control. While we no longer have a “quest for perfect illusion” (Manovich), it is still talked about in how we build our characters. &quot;The dominances of photographic and cinematic imagery&quot;, very “efficient for cultural 
” - but we have another way to communicate, a more challenged but particular way. Don’t want to abandon computationality. Bogost on simulators - “The closer one gets to the perfection of a simulacrum… the more evident it becomes”. Dansky (2007) - &quot;immersion is arguably the ultimate goal of videoogames&quot; - issues of identification &quot;fully simulate human though, behaviour, emotions is a long way off&quot; - but this is missing the point entirely! Issue also that it is contained on a machine - the &quot;naive physics of computing&quot; - a book can do what a book can do, we don't expect it to do anything else - we feel that there is no upper bound to the machine. These ideas of realism and freedom in games do not correspond to drama - need more limitation (Re. Laurel). &quot;graphic sophistication began yielding diminishing returns&quot; - “Increasingly visceral representational technologies”. Not trying to make strong AI - we talk about it a lot, even if we do not rely on it in our games or art. Vaucanson’s duck - a “good example of simulation” - not the innards, just the excretions. “A simulator will become a work that shows the intrinsic impossibility of representing a chosen subject with playable computer graphics, rather than computation’s inevitable mastery of the physical world”.&quot;the achievement of photorealism is the main goal of research in the field of computer graphics&quot; - manovich sees this as the reason they aren't seen as art. Uncanny valley becomes a problem. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers &quot;don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.&quot;[ Think that “serious technical limitations” no longer exist - I think they do. Partiality - Anthropy and Clark talk about &quot;elegance&quot; of design keeping things as simple as possible.In theater, we write a script, but the actor’s performance of it is up to her. But we nevertheless compose the shape of the scene. We give the player (another theater word) liberty to perform a scene; this is where the choices come in. The choices that a player makes come from the verbs we give her, so we have the ability to constrain and design what those choices are. A fictionalized ideal of the videogame is that it gives the player the ability to do anything, to choose anything. There are games that aim for this kind of wish fulfillment and mostly result in weak
experiences, lacking cohesion and focus. Talking about sophisticated psychological modelling for agents - this is a lot of work, though. Also, artists relying on somebody else's model of psychology.  - &quot;highly codified situation&quot; - we do not expect to be able to do lots of different things with character. Illusion of intelligence is only possible because of severe limitations.

&quot;The tech world is driven by aggressive utopianism tied to a commercial drive. Therefore, AI (and tech art, in many ways) rarely looks backward, only forward.&quot;

Not saying not to rely on technology, or to query new technologies. As Mullaney points out, technology is a means to express. After all, new techniques within a medium should never be rejected because of Romanticism. (What new techniques and technologies does the masterbeast rely on?) However, the relentless pursuit of new engineering as a panacea for a very human problem (relating to a representation) will not bear fruit in general. Arguably, the problem has not improved. And systematising takes us away from the audience, to finding more and more formal techniques to solve our problems, which in their turn produce new problems, and must ultimately come down to the same judge - the audience. “The visionary impulse fades away as technological progress becomes the sole focus”. NAUGHTY DOGS APPROACH OF USING HUMAN ACTORS TO IMPROVE BELIEVABILITY.“Games sired by these new technologies emphasize tech aspects over dramatic themes”.Emmanuel Tanguy - facial animations “could influence people’s perception of a virtual actor” - different facial expressions but displayed concurrently. 2 types of emotions/facial expressions - serconday emotion and mood. Mood is a chording effect, a modifier, each displayed together to display complex emotion - also not just a technical feat, but a semantic feat as well - understanding the construction of emotion on a face intimately. &quot;more realistic gestures and facial expressions&quot; There is a difference between game characters as engineering success and artistic success. They can be brought together, but rarely are. 
Points out that game character's issues comes from increased simulatory power - uncanny valley. &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; rather than deliberately abstract.We argue that believability is a more practical concept than intelligence. - bogdanovych et al 
What I am building is what Russel and Norvig would call a “model-based reflex agent” or model-based, goal-based agent. - built using BOD, a 11-year-old method that does not rely on internal state very much. What is the internal state model like?“It is a common mistake that the more complex the AI in the game, the better the characters will look to the player”

Limitations of the Gamemaker engine = fruitful - especially for somebody who could learn everything, try everything - don’t WANT to have all of the current techniques available to me
“Constructing large common sense knowledge bases by hand, an approach that has not fared well to date&quot; - is there somewhere in the middle - imbuing a system with knowledge but leaving some of it to occur outside.



Relying On Multiplayer - that is, have all characters in the game be PCs, and do not try to create a systemic character at all. Allow a human mind to be behind the computation? “Multiplayer games have
been the rule rather than the exception for most of history”

Why doesn’t this really always work. Still bound by the design of the system - what people can do with their character can still affect resonance. Also then have issues of them not sticking to the coherence truth of the world - messing about. Also, this is not really the focus of this - looking at ways that a system can create a character through authorship. This is a separate challenge; as a methodology, I am interesting in my ability to author characters, not author roles for humans to perform. Also makes escapism, an important part. Competitive multiplayer games have a long legacy of putting this responsibility in the hands of players. “Single-player games face a different kind of problem because the player is alone in conver-sation with a system that can only say as much as its designer has allowed it to.”

Pursuing ‘Believability’ - problems of this.


Games Without Characters - games which have no NPCs. Will talk about this more in Chapter 3. &quot;If a game works without a character, it shouldn't have one&quot;. Very, very popular now (egs?). However, cannot be the entirety of the artform. Again, this problem of sticking to certain things. This is a genre technique, should not be a medium-related one. Not pushing the envelope. “Walking simulators were always doomed to be a transitional form” (Bogost) - not sure I agree with “transitional”, but certainly not the be-all and end-all.

The ‘Indie Scene’ - Often seen as a saviour for the artform, indeed elevating to an ‘artform’ - many resonant characters come from these games (examples?). Developed between 2008/2010 (Indie Entitlement). Is it that different? “White dudes remaking Mario” ( Anna Anthropy). Points out blurring of boundaries between mainstream and indie. Characters still have this problem here - more ‘serious’ subject matter, but still handled using existing paradigms, often. Important to resonant character, but not the ‘saviour’ as it is portrayed to be. A ‘stagnant culture’ with a ‘cult of marketability’. Still &quot;simple technological 'hook'[s] or larger-scale complicated technical systems.&quot; “the indie space is little different from the AAA space&quot; (Indie Entitlement). The rise of the “empathy game”, which systematise emotions, or just layer emotion over existing game designs. ‘Empathy is not a genre’. Or often constrain narrative (games without characters, games with restricted characters) or the system, which is fine, but not all games can do this. &quot;games have been ringing changes on the same few subjects&quot;. In indie games, even though the dressing is different, the mechanics underneath are often the same. Much  of  the  “indie  games” movement  is  about  questioning  the  designed  presumptions  of  mainstream commercial  games. - is it really, Eric? We can’t always rely on puzzles, gamey elements for our characterisation. The home of the “reflective choice”, and indeed the “reflective” NPC (TWD) - not really systemic. Nothing wrong with this, but not potential. “Your decision… will be of ethical importance to yourself.” The ‘illusion’ of choice, as well. “Illusion of control” (klug) - maybe need to choose more carefully what is controlled. Tightly controlled realm in TWD and Fables, but still has issues. &quot;This has lead to both creative and critical tensions over the past decade with the rise of genres that put aside an interest in intellectualised and complex systems in place of invoking particular emotions.&quot; These guys (Anthropy and Clark) are talking about 'games', which have a specific goal as a piece of art - not all computer systems need this. I’m more with Samyn. A lot of what she talks about is about moving in space, rules, manipulation, power, danger.  &quot;zinesters&quot; - anna anthropy - Difficulty of changing the culture - &quot; a world of roguelikes, in-jokes and assumed knowledge?&quot;. “In recent years low-interaction, low-challeneg 3-D games have become quite popular”. T (rapture)Trying to frame NPC convos with camera - a type of agency. TWA (study) - felt that strong characterisation not tied to her interactions, didn’t lead to character development “doing the story for them” - &quot;empathy is not a genre&quot; - not just the types of stoories, but the types of systems.
&quot;often overwritten and designed to limit the amount of dynamism or development the characters are allowed to have&quot;
Indie scene cannot escape mercantilism as well.
&quot;A lot of the same stories are being told right now&quot; (Campo Santo).

Conclusions

The problems are large, and widespread, and make creating resonant computational characters very difficult. It is a problem that reflects on the challenges of narratives in computational art in general - “repetitive themes and stereotyped storylines” (Ryan), beautiful but empty worlds, and a continuing lack of resonance despite great technological advances. Characters that we don’t “give a shit” about (Life Is Strange lady at AI Summit), “too simple” nodal, mechanical realities, subservient to the game’s structure, in which the “pretty fragile… illusion of humanity” (Elizabeth talk) is routinely destroyed, to the point where it is no longer worried about, and even lampooned and capitalised by the companies that produce such characters. &quot;The best interactive stories are still worse than even middling books and films&quot;. “Hardly any games, or interactive media of any sort, can reasonably aspire to character believability within this technical generation.” (Togelius) - still sees it as an issue of tech! &quot;such game moments are far too rare&quot; - characters as drivers of emotions in games. Games are still about &quot;mainly interacting with purely &quot;physical&quot; processes&quot;  Jesper Juul (more ludologist) - in zimmerman's piece in First Person - maybe privileging character, plot etc. is the problem, that games aren'y goof gor this. &quot;asking games to focus on their weaknesses rather than their strengths&quot;

Has led to a strange abnegation of character in the industry - Bethesda making fun of its own characters, is fun to play around with them - but isn’t that weird, that we are doing that? &quot;Instead of embracing the artistic potential of the medium, we have retreated into the comfortable zone of gaming.&quot;
 &quot;most of the time they go unnoticed, sitting on the periphery, regurgitating the same three Lines&quot;
Klug points out do want &quot;interactive traditional storytelling&quot;, but also systemics. - therefore an author of a suystem
Some people think we should give up. Ludologist/narratologist debate - games, and by extension computer systems, cannot do empathy, or character, very well, because of their very nature. Celia Pearce points out that games, producing unauthored experiences, will find characters outside of the avatar very difficult. &quot;Games are good at objectification. Stories are good at empathy. Games tend to quantise, reduce and classify. Stories tend to blur, deepen and make subtle distinctions&quot;. “The objective of creating a fully believable NPC within a game may be an impossible one.” Koster questions whether games can do things like character well. Literature is more broad in its outlook. &quot;Can a game designer pick anying to simulate, or are there inherent limitations&quot; - Robinett thinks that anything can be simulated. S+Z think that the fact that games need to be about conflict might predispose games to certain narratives. (Conflict over territory (char as enviro), economic conflict or conflict over knowledge.) but that there is the potential for exploration. “Just as in real life, the worlds of literary fiction are replete with complicated individuals whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration.” “Videogames tend to focus on fighting and strategy, exploration, puzzle-solving… these types of external conflicts are far easier to portray in a game-like fashion than the more internal emotional conflicts that are often the focus of things like romance novels and sitcoms.”

&quot;natural or believable [characters] cannot be achieved mechanically, or by copying, or wishful thinking, but only by careful building, understanding, and a love for the characters.&quot;

“If videogames currently rely on external action, can a playable game be made where the focus is on internal action?” - McMullan
In 1984, Turkle called games “a new kind of intimacy with machines”  not so new anymore, but still not very intimate.
This creates both opportunities and challenges for creators of these works - producing 'resonant' characters (i.e. those from which Oatley's simulation can be run satisfactorily) is difficult, because so much more needs to be simulated/built (creative burden), much more complicated, work within the mechanical/digital system of the experience, work well with the player's input. So much more can go wrong in the transmission/conversation between, and we do not have a good grammar/techniques, yet, for producing beings - the grammars are being developed for other things, and more traditional techniques ladled on top, or the idea of character.
“Games need to make people care about their subjects, and their subject’s feelings.”
&quot;My confidence in the future of literature consists in the knowledge that there are things that only literature can give us, by means specific to it&quot;
&quot;many experiences can be considered narrative experiences. How would we make a game-story about these kinds of subjects?&quot;
, a “hypothetical future [in which] players could interact with computerized characters as round as those in novels or films, making choices that would influence an ever-evolving plot.&quot; (Bogost).

            <Title>Solution: Applying Reader-Response And Autocosmics To Computational Media</Title>
            <Text>These are the major problems that make it challenging to produce resonant computational characters that explore the fuller potentials of their medium - problems of the nature of the medium, the nature of the approaches taken, and the solutions proposed. For some, the conclusion is that computational art cannot be a character-led medium - that even if narrative has its place, the difficulty of creating resonant virtual beings means that character-based narrative experiences will never be the forte of the medium.
I see this as a challenge - have been heartened by many of the experiences I have had with computational characters (examples?), and believe that actually their potential is great - different from that of books or film, but that we can find novel ways of approaching the creation of character, outside of the mainstream.
This project takes up the challenge, and a series of approaches, exemplified by the artwork itself (in the design of the installation and the masterbeast, and the themes and specifics of the narrative explored in the Housekeeping) to try and surmount these challenges and produce a resonant computational character, using an approach informed by my concept of autocosmics explored in the last chapter.
It is a holistic approach - as the third and fourth chapters shall demonstrate, the entire artwork, both its explicitly computational and non-computational elements, takes up this challenge. At its heart, it is an approach which attempts to balance the role of imagination and of digital procedurality in creating such characters.


The First Half Of This Balance - Imagination, &amp; The Nature And Location Of Computation

Using the imagination to &quot;paste over&quot; the difficulties of creating meaningful, character-led systems is nothing new - games rely heavily on psychological and imaginative impulses in their audience to augment their concrete representations. This is not a controversial or new stance. This has become a very important, fashionable stance. The “weak AI” approach. Origins in Turing Test - “aesthetic illusion is therefore a transmedial, transmodal and transgeneric phenomenon” - &quot;an agent’s capacity to both enable and manage the adoption of the intentional stance in a player&quot; - &quot;predictable, contextual behavior is enough to trigger the intentional stance, through a process not dissimilar to narrative closure, and an information load that gives just enough to enable this process – but no more&quot;
It is not novel to say that, like every type of artwork, the imagination, the autocosmics, of the audience is an important augmentative force in the resonance of the characters and narratives contained within it - even if we frame this as a different type of computation. This is not something which games and other computational artforms neglect - all of them realise, even in their technological utopianism, that “the success of an AI-based artwork is based on audience perception&quot;. Mention this exemplified in the perceived differences between ‘academic’ AI and ‘industry’ AI (Togelius and others), especially in the work on ‘non-platonic AI’ by Bungie in HALO and now copied by many others. “Tricks, arcane optimizations, and unproven techniologies” - since the early days of simpler characters. “Whereas computer simulations run on computers, literary simulations… run on minds” - So according to this theory the performance of a play or the text of a novel is a simulation just as a computer program can be a simulation; and in order to work the simulation must be run.” - However, it has been debated whether humanlike internal processes are necessary at all, or whether the replication of surface displays is sufficient for a believable and effective communication. Kramer, Iurgel, and Bente (2005) argue that to reach the ultimate goal of an ECA – to make the human–computer interaction more intuitive and to manipulate the emotions of the user – it is not necessary to simulate internal processes in terms of an emotion model or motivation model. Instead they propose a conversational function model where emotional expressions are seen as purely instrumental and disconnected from the feeling of emotions (cf. Fridlund, 1991) - Companion cube
“When you are designing a game you are not designing just a set of rules, but a set of rules that will always be experienced as play within a cultural context… you never have the luxury of forgetting about context”
Turkle’s ”tools to think with”.


“The computer, like a Rorshach inkblot test, is a powerful projective medium.” 
“A stirring narrative in any medium can be experienced as a virtual reality”
Games are very interested in neuroscience and player's perceptions - (The Gamer's Brain, Celia Hodent)


Talk about Oatley here - “the mind’s flight simulator”, fiction “offer[s] us cues to our theory-of-mind processes” - “get the whole thing to run” - his view of mimesis as simulation, “run on the minds of the audience, as a computer simulation runs on a computer”, novels and plays “guide the simulation process” - “Literary simulations run on minds of audiences or readers, just as computer simulations run on computers.”
“Only, it may be that humanity’s capacity for living in empirical and virtual worlds at once is not a late-twentieth century development, even if current technology brings this characteristic into sharper relief. It may be that varieties of theater and games of all sorts have always been helping us into the place away from the lives that nature forces on us, where the worlds we imagine are possible.” - “A stirring narrative in any medium can be experienced as a virtual reality”

The many ways that games and other computational artworks have courted and used the ‘aesthetic illusion’ AND “non-aesthetic illusion” of the audience, especially with characters - “reflective choices” or “the illusion of choice” (Anthropy &amp; Clark) in games (The Walking Dead) - If you look for choice, you are ‘robbing yourself of the illusion’ “Power over plot seems limited” - ontological geek - Games like The Wolf Among Us have their ma- jor plot points laid out and will follow through with their progression no matter what the player does - but there are still plenty of options given to her. Their purpose is to re- flect on the events of the story rather than to lead them. In this perspective, &quot;The actor’s reasons for taking their actions are predetermined by the author to lend believability to their behaviours&quot;(Thue, Bulitko, &amp; Spetch, 2008). (Stadeler) - Abbott and many other fans find her even more compelling than a character in a work of fiction, because players of the game are responsible for her survival.(BUT NOT REALLY!) - , the “representational and narrative power” of the computer with ELIZA and PARRY through the “intentional stance” (re. H&amp;S - Talk about parasites as tribute to heider and simmels experiment, now called ‘The ELIZA Effect’ - - &quot;attributing greater intelligence or intentionality to a machine than it possesses&quot;  Braitenberg Vehicles (Emmeche)) - “Weizenbaum had set out to make a clever computer program and had unwittingly created a believable character” (Murray), “maintains the illusion… with very little machinery” commented on by Thomas Was Alone - “love how such simple shapes can form such strong personalities… found myself imagining little conversations between them as I played.“ (Stephen O’Donnell) - in study, gendering characters, switching between first and third person depending on control, even though he said ““If these two can even be called characters” or “ridiculous” to say that they had personalities - naming him, telling him to “come on, Thomas/you”, compares them to a friend’s ex-boyfriend or their friends with the same name,, gives them personality traits such as “innocent”, “pessimistic”, “rude” - “It’s not just a block”. Even felt like the narration was paying attention to what she did! Thomas’ dark soul was alone says that we don’t really need the narrator, could turn the sound off. &quot;I found myself describing the game avatars as if they were social others without cognizantly recognizing I was doing so. &quot; &quot;Looking at things pragmatically, the role of the team is to build a system that shows signs of intelligence. &quot;The best strategy for that is to find the right balance between human supervision and technology.&quot; - “Ideally you want to borrow the intelligence of the designers to make the AI seem smart, but you want to use the generalization of code to make the intelligence procedural (you can’t ship a designer on a CD).”

Matea’s “interactionist AI” - based on player participation rather than GOFAI which thought about technological completeness and interiority.
Huizinga’s “playing of the mind” in personification - let the mind do some of the processing.
This is essentially what “believability” is, as an approach - relying on the player’s imagination to perceive the agents as fully-formed beings. T&amp;B - believability as 'experienced' (in player's mind) rather than 'encoded' (drawing on magerko's work on believability being in the eye of the beholder). &quot;the field of intentional agents within computer science can be seen as creating programs to which humans take the intentional stance&quot; - NIM looking at this as well. “Thus, the general idea of believability is to enhance and ease human–machine interaction by using natural and intuitive codes of human communication” -  Humans have certain expectations about communicative signals, patterns, and reactions of interaction partners. Believability of an ECA means that humans can apply their usual mental models of communication.
“The beauty of the NPC illusion is that, when well-done, it can hide enormous limitations in the interactivity of the character.”
User Model and System Model - about the allying the two of them. &quot;mental models are not always accurate&quot; - &quot;Mental Models&quot; (1983 &amp; 2006, Johnson-Laird) paper, &quot;internal model&quot; Veldhuyzen and Stassen (1976) 1953 Kenneth Craik used the term, Willet Kempton's &quot;folk theory&quot;, using simulation to inform decisions - princeton paper talks about applying rules in a mental simulation - conditionals, etc - &quot;A mental model is a representation of some domain or situation that supports understanding, reasoning, and prediction&quot; (Gentner) - &quot;naive or folk theories&quot; - &quot;qualitiative relations&quot; between things - Games are very interested in neuroscience and player's perceptions - (The Gamer's Brain, Celia Hodent) - design is all about predicting errors in mental models and allowing for them. 
In McCorduck’s definition, I am not creating intelligence, bu inviting it.
Less narratively - through affordance, “juice”, the work of Donald Norman, 
Remember, imagination is a continuum - therefore, in all cases, it is about entering into a reception contract, both subconscious and conscious, to allow what is represented to resonate - and that resonance can be triggered by very small representations.
“The architecture is crafted in such a way as to enable just those authorial affordances that allow the artists to manipulate the interpretive affordances dictated by the concept of the piece.” 
Hilgard - “transportation… may be too passive” (in Oatley)
“nothing between the audience and the stage [or functionality] but some good illusion.” (Laurel)
The human being is an “indisputable ingredient of the representation” (Laurel)
simulations of fiction allow 'personal truths' to be explored -&gt; emtional response, understand aspects of themselves.
Games are not a self-contained logical system - they involve human psychology 
&quot;Expressive AI views a system as a performance&quot;
&quot;AI researcher strives to eliminate any reference to human perception of their artifact&quot; - what about HCI, I think he's being reductive.
Believability comes close to what we want - both how the look and the system.
“Naive physics of computing”
Semiotics relates to our ability to understand that signs represent. 
Games are not just mechnical constraints, but semiotic constraints as well - affordances.
“Glitches in a character’s though process can be interpreted in many acceptable ways (hestiation, sluggisheness, character flaws)”
Naomi Alderman talking about parsing her character's flaws.
“Computer interface acts as a code that carries cultural messages”?
&quot;It remains to be seen whether we can capture the illusion of &quot;the incalculability of life&quot; with the emotional calculus of the computer. In the meantime, the most pleasurably surprising interactive characters may be those who are created with considerably less programming.&quot;
Reversal of Weiz' prophesy in a way - we now realise the limitations of computing, certainly in the arts.
Extra Credits (Enriching Lives) - Geth conundrum in Mass Effect 2 - small computational remit, but the narrative remit provides the depth. 
Don't always need mechanical stats - the autocosmic tendency will cover the drawing of meaning.
Problem of relying on autocosmics - we &quot;iconify&quot; things we see a lot, break it down. 

&quot;the bare mechanics of the game do not determine its semantic freight&quot; - a combination of the two.
&quot;the rules [should be] onformed by our understanding of human beings themselves - counters that react according to the newly discovered rules of human minds&quot;
S+Z - we &quot;participate in [their] representation&quot; (the characters)
Narrative descriptors - explicit, concrete representations which help reveal the narrative in games. Essentially representations that use autocosmics to lend narrative meaning to the activities.

&quot;It does not come as a surprise, however, that despite fierce opposition, particularly in recent cultural history, aesthetic illusion seems to be more alive than ever and continues to influence the development of contemporary (digital) technology for, in particular, commercial representations (resulting, e.g., in the enhanced life-likeness of films on blu-ray 3 D discs with dolby 5.1 surround sound), since immersion appears to cater well to a fundamental human need for imaginary experience.&quot;
“a conceptual model… doesn’t have to be complete or even accurate, as long as it is useful”
“dictional personality” - as performance
Amazingly, when examined closely, memorable characters in IF are really doing much the same things that their more forgettable counterparts are doing -- roaming about the map, reacting to single words, serving as puzzles to be overcome by the right object or objects to overcome the right puzzle. 
Talk about autocosmics - about how players (p20) think that the Pacman ghosts have better AI than they do.
“Simple things that can give the illusion of intelligence” - simple things are good, but maybe not good enough.
Games have a cultural context - this informs the autocosmics. Your relationship with these characters. Reflect and transform culture through play. Consider games &quot;as a cultural text&quot;.

“What videogames do so well is not a sudden phenomenon. It is a continuation and convergence of a variety of art practices over hundreds of years.”
Character glitches can become character, can become part of how we play the game - but disconnects the narrative from the gameplay, the experience.
“Perceived info” is autocosmics.
“System fully come to life”
“Dormant relationships”
The Cognitivist Theory of Affordances in Games is thus a theoretical contribution, which synthesizes several views by presenting three independent manipulable entities that are relevant to the study of games: 1) real affordances, what actions are possible in a game, 2) perceived affordances, what actions players perceive possible in a game, and 3) feedback, perceptual information introduced in the game by its designers to advertise real
affordances in the hopes of eliciting accurate perceived affordances.


The Second Half Of This Balance - The Computational, The Systemic

Must keep the systemic, computational nature of the medium in mind, and strive to use imagination in conjunction with the systemic - this is the medium we have, and it is only becoming more complicated in this regard. We cannot be scared of, or disregard, the grammar of the medium. “The vocabulary of a game’s system can help convey a story through its very structure.” “the expressive power of video games flows through their formal qualities”.
However, the system itself is also important - this is the stuff of the artist, this is the opportunity, the potential, for comp art. Cannot neglect the system as a medium, as a locale of the meaning. Do not take reader-response ideas that there is no inherent meaning in the text - it is instilled by a human being, the author (need more pro-author rhetoric here?) - somewhere between the formalists and the reader-response people. Need formalism, in a way. We have the opportunity to create systems that have inherent meaning, inherent ways of working that mean something, that we can observe and which resonate with us as we augment them imaginatively as well. Need more of a balance. I see this balance lacking in many games at the moment. 
“The AI-based artist should avoid architectural elaborations which are not visible to the audience.” - not sure I agree with him. Visibility is also a relative thing. Eliza Effect - cannot be completely hidden internal structure, or completely open. (NWF).
Turkle worries that the rules of games (mathematical in nature) are limiting. She thinks that making the rules too clear is a bad idea - freeform play allows identification, simulation, fictive empathy - we can have both, as has been proved.
&quot;The entertainment industry has long believed that the highest payoffs would come from offering the public media that combine action and imaginative identification.”
&quot; the game can withhold some of the complexities of the rules from the player. When the player discovers those complexities later, it feels like a story is developing.&quot;
Looking at Formalist and other positions of character arising emergent from system - I am interested in this, but also we are making a system.
Don’t just simulate very basic things and leave the narrative significance to non-systemics - must combine the two.
Balance between “performance and simulation” of intelligence.
Pinchbeck - &quot;ecological sense&quot; or &quot;ecological validity&quot; - whether things make sense within the system or through &quot;semantic characterisation&quot; - both are important. 
Bringjord - Need &quot;rich mental structures&quot;, a &quot;theory of mind&quot; - too many deficiencies, too much partiality in the wrong place, and it all falls apart. 
They think that &quot;simple engineering tricks&quot; are not enough.
They can be, sometimes, but don't see them as tricks - as how we relate to other people as well.
Tricking &quot;will always fail&quot; 
Think about how the autocosmic narratives we are telling ourselves fit the reality of the system.
Consider behaviourism &quot;bankrupt&quot;
Is necessarily partial (Forrester, 1971)
There are some very specific systemics in TWA (”level design created a bit of camaraderie”, had “interdependency”), but not a lot, not a lot of room for self-expression - not open, still tightly controlled, manipulated.
Just relying on imagination can lead to “thresholds of credulity”, where the system cannot keep up with the imagination. See this generally in the Problems section.This can lead to a “system” which is superficially ‘believable’, but which doesn’t bear up to scrutiny, which is inevitably what players will do. Imagination and human computation in the marketing process - simulate the game before it exists - this can be a problem. CRIT - Telltale games set an ‘obvious expectation’ for meaningful choices which is then let down - this is partly marketing - maybe we should talk less mechanistically about this stuff. 
&quot;the game can withhold some of the complexities of the rules from the player. When the player discovers those complexities later, it feels like a story is developing.&quot;
But they are building a &quot;micromodel&quot; - maybe a full mental model is not possible.
I do have a very simple model of this.
Frude -  A much stronger animistic effect can be expected
when there is an opportunity for the user to interact with systems that have simulated
character.
Need &quot;animism, artistry and AI&quot; in equal measures. Imagination, authorship and systematics.
The systematics has been the problem, for Frude.
Mateas’ “interactionist” approach needs to be balanced with some of the structures from GOFAI. (as I have done in the creature). 
Not just about authorial intent - must let go to a certain extent, but it certainly seems that bugs are the slipping away of authorial intent from the system - (In Defense of Bethesda’s Bugs) a player decides that that is the only reality, not what the author ‘intended’.
Allying the system model and user model does not just mean “complete transparency” - it is about managing not just narrative mystery, but systemic mystery as well, and using each to reveal the other.

However, it has been debated whether humanlike internal processes are necessary at all, or whether the replication of surface dis- plays is sufficient for a believable and effective communication. Kra ¨mer, Iurgel, and Bente (2005) argue that to reach the ultimate goal of an ECA – to make the human–computer interaction more intuitive and to manipulate the emotions of the user – it is not necessary to simulate internal processes in terms of an emotion model or motivation model. Instead they propose a conversational function model where emotional expressions are seen as purely instrumental and disconnected from the feeling of emotions (cf. Fridlund,
1991). - don't need to have this, but do need to think about the systems that you do have - are the characters part of this?
“Physical simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence” - comparing to the birth of flight - we are not attempting to fly.

The balance between the two of these is the real issue - between the imagined and the represented, not between “play and narrative”, or “story and game”. Deciding what parts of the drum to build - which pieces will resonate, and how. What to be computed on machine and what in the mind. I have experienced  some computational artworks that I think have gotten the balance right (examples? Galatea, Thomas Was Alone) - which gives me hope. Many of the problems of character come from the pendulum swinging too far one way or another, her story, to a certain extent. Emergence - Steven Johnson (discernible macro-behaviours), Conway’s game of life. Telling stories about patterns. Game of Life - “wonderful example of the principles of emergence and complexity”


My Own Attempt At Balance - An Autocosmic Approach

The struggles of computational character, if we take Curries’/Pearces’ approach, is the struggle of computational narrative itself - how to ally it to the methodology and the form of the computational, not just how to layer a story on top. Separating “game” and “story” seems very wrong-headed.
Computational art’s interest in human psychology often seems cynical, or more concerned with ‘tricks’ - compulsion loops, or utilising more traditional techniques from the arts - such as aesthetic illusion. We are not making bookish or filmic characters. “The majority… of game stories [are] delivered using techniques from other media.” - “artists have been working to understand it for millennia.” - Loyall says to draw on characters from across the arts. Not sure it’s such a good idea! &quot;comparing new media to print, photography or telvision will never tell us the whole story&quot; - new media is just another kind of computer data. How does this influence characters? Maybe we do not to look to the arts, but not to the explicitly ‘narrative’ forms.T&amp;B are all about using models “distilled from literary fiction, film and theater”, like Loyall.
So, autocosmic approach - autocosmics, the totality of imagination, relies on there being something to augment - not just a surface representation, to be computed elsewhere, but something inherent within the world (which we might misunderstand, change or interpret differently, but it is still there) - how can we author this, rather than relying on meaning arising from the glitches? Games use autocosmics all the time, but in a way to create very simplistic characters (mainly based on movement) or for other, less character-based things. They then rely on the resonance techniques of books and films to provide the more &quot;advanced&quot; characterisations, layered into the system itself, or clumsily on top. Look more broadly at the autocosmic, b/c it is closer to real life - not books or films, not merely the &quot;simulation run on the mind&quot;, but the simulation run on the computer as well - not one, or the other, but both. My character is limited in many ways (list them) but it is an artistic response to this need to focus on a balance of systemic integrity, a coherence truth within the system, and an imaginative augmentation. It compares and contrasts these techniques. It is not a solution to this issue, but a creative response to it.

Sometimes offloading the wrong things onto the imagination, and systematising the wrong things as well. Sticking with game structures not always a good idea. This idea of ‘not hiding anything’ from the player - this is wrong-headed. A system does need to hide things, they do need to work it out - still needs to be a coherence truth. this is the unique promise. PARRY had a &quot;rudimentary model of an inner life&quot;. More distinctive is what Bungie say about their AI.
Autocosmics, as a concept, can help us get this balance right again between resonance and systemics.. About understanding imagination as how we see and process the entire world, not divided between real and fictional.
Waiting In The Sky - creating your own associations from random patterns. 
Henry Jenkins agrees not to rely too heavily on the narrative form, and not too heavily on mechanics. Other forms are very different. Autocosmics seem to represent game narratives most closely, so focus on that.
 Autocosmics is about thinking about narrative, and character, more generally - more contiguous with life. Computational art is more like life - about creating an environment in which narrative can take place. More like our evolutionary roots. The Longest Night - “we’re pattern finders! Find some patterns!” Koster talks about this, who else? S+Z's semotic approach to games - systematising markers to make meaning - interpreted by audience. Drawing on Saussure’s work. Lucas and Licinio’s “sensemaking”. Lend themselves really well to interpretation - &quot;partly told without words&quot; - more like a real system, like the real world (Solutions). (Clark) - “Perceiving stories is part of how we understand our world. Just as we can see patterns in the arrangement of shapes and forms—animals in the clouds or a face in the knots of a tree—we make stories out of things that happen around us. We impose a pattern, a meaningful sequence, on a set of events, and a story emerges. “This, then, is one of the most basic ways in which videogames speak to us as the real world does, directly to the visceral, animal brain— even as they tease the higher imagination by building a universe that could never exist”. Videogames “continuous wiith real life in a way that is instrumental.” (Keogh) - He calls games the aesthetic form of everyday life - links to autocosmics.Manovich - “book and computer interfaces “fundamentally different and ultimately incompatible approaches”

Gives us leave to look away from the other arts towards those arenas in which imagination in general matters. Broaden our sources of inspiration. Somewhere in between this idea of &quot;story as exertion&quot; and &quot;story as intermission&quot;. “I freely embrace approaches from any ideology or combination of ideologies that allows the best progress toward believable Agents”. McCorduck - poetry is individual view (romantic), science is universal view (pragamtic) - “neither view obviates the other” - “when you start making things outside of the convention of what is normal or good or &quot;best practices&quot;, you're also shedding some of the baggage that comes with the concept of what a game &quot;should&quot; be.” &quot;it is critical that games be placed in context with the rest of human endeavor so that game designers can feel comfortable venutring outside their field in search of innovative ideas&quot;

Specifically a methodology for authors wishing to say something - an authored approach (look at the title). - “Players want to have the experience that a worthy game intends”, “focus on player takeaways and outcomes often outweighs consideration for the artists intent” (Dan Solberg). Resonance is not about slavish devotion to what you think your audience wants. Dispense with or at least significantly reframe the author’s role as creator of content - celia pearce - disagree - still the author, still part of it, need to author it. &quot;know thy user&quot; - the hci mantra (in interaction design book) Hansen 1971 - we are interested in this in a way, but more about creating art for ourselves - this is the thing with resonance - more about the human. &quot;user experience... has become the central concern of interaction design&quot; - &quot;user experience&quot; instead of &quot;illusion&quot;. A narrative that is evaluated, like anyuthing else. &quot;one cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience&quot;. Less about the &quot;corect&quot; user experience (as in product design) and more about an &quot;interesting&quot; user experience (as in art). A methodology where “design and code” (Griesmer) overlap - theory and practicality - specific approaches and general metaphors. Still authored story, traditional elements and assets, not entirely “player-driven”. Aesthetics are still important (David O’Reailly), but away from “surface style” to how the assets work together as a system of meaning. Also interested in &quot;authorial affordance&quot; - how the system allows for artistic expression by the artist 'under the hood'. The story of it as an object MADE BY SOMEONE is important. Leigh Alexander - bring back linear, written narratives -&gt; writers need to be part of design team. “Participation in an immersive environment has to be carefully structured and constrained.” They say that the issue of agent dynamism has to come from method learning rather than hand-coded knowledge engineering. “Refusal to author results in…banality” - Expressing a detailed interactive character’s behavior in Hap is an artistic expression just as painting or animation is. - Loyall
Agree with Laurel that should work with a representation of internal system, not directly - but how should that representation look?
The Formalists - interested in the system, the 'text'. Big links in computational narratology.
Currently in art practice don't care about tech/system - &quot;The machine itself is considered a hack, an accidental byproduct of the artist's engagement with the concept of the piece. In the documentation of electronic media works, the internal structure of the machine is almost systematically effaced.&quot; - is this still true? Hiding gaps, the simplicity of it, maybe, or deliberately mystifying the machine underneath. Idon't want to do this either
Expressive AI does sit somewhere in the middle. using interaction to express a system.
&quot;interaction design than appearance design to foster the social human–agent relation”
Kismet by Brazeal - this sort of socially situated, learning robot - a big project - learn from people, draw people in - ““Kismet is a social robot designed to socially interact with humans” - good mix of human and performance, looking outside the box.
Best games are the ones that tightly marry their narrative (if they have one) to play in order to make both meaningful.
Simulations must be reducible to maths - this does present a challenge.
“The meaningful play that you provide for your players emerges from the designed system of a game - and how that game interacts with larger social and cultural systems.”
&quot;the emotional power of video games draws heavily on the computer power with that supports a simulated world and a meditative environment.&quot;
“You do get quite attached to them, despite the limited interactions you have with them”.
“Literary works, according to this
model,resemblemachines: theyaretheresultofaninten-
tional human activity in which a specific skill transforms
rawmaterialintoacomplexmechanismsuitableforapar-
ticular purpose” (Steiner, “Russian Formalism” 18)
Through observation of a complex system, stop iconifying.
We are fighting against autocosmics, to a certain extent. We over-simplify because of twitch responses of people.
Better graophics, better plots, stories, sound effects, music etc. but not better systems. Not just better systems for char, but better resonance
“Observabilirt” - but black boxes are also important.
“Honesty” in how a system works - not necessarily, a system keeping its secrets…
&quot;cultural layer&quot; (what is represented) and the &quot;computer layer&quot; (the raw data)
HCI balances &quot;between the two poles of computer logic and human logic&quot; - perception, cognition, causality and motivation.
NWF - surface between data/processes and audience. Don't want to obscure systems complete (Talespin Effect)
&quot;to think about the relationship between the audience's experience and the system's internal operations&quot;
 intrinsic or extrinsic meaning.
“Rules are merely means for creating play”
Digitsal games are better at imperfect info as can manipulate lots of info “behind scene”
How much info is know to player (perfect vs. Imperfect) - all info gains value from its relationship with others. (info ecosystem).

4 - Specific Approaches In masterbeast

I think that I have made a more resonant character using this approach, and more resonant characters. I have tried to think about my Project as a whole from this autocosmic perspective. It both comments upon the difficulties that I have already mentioned in its fiction, and tried to explore autocosmic methods of developing characters. 
Lots of different techniques - examples? - but for this essay I want to focus on one, important and emblematic one- one which tries to look at the paradigms we have in place already as a way to drive systemic and resonant character autocosmically.
Devising architectures and algorithms that create rich behavior supporting player projection is one of the fundamental goals of game AI.
The problem with technological fetishism - this is why IO am using an entry-level tool, with many limitations/problems - require creative solving.
Fundamentally, this is about constructing space for narrative - usually geographic space. END.
&quot;games do need to illuminate aspects of ourselves we did not understand fully.”
&quot;the point at whcich our game puzzles approach the complexity of the puzzles in other art forms is the point at which the game art form becomes mature.&quot;
&quot;Video games don’t have a great record with relationships&quot;
being &quot;immersed in meaning&quot;, as well as immersed in the representation. This is important, autocosmics.
Weiz - “respect, understanding and love are not technical problems”
 “the interface becomes the arena for the performance of some task in which both human and computer have a role”
Jenova Chen - &quot;life is relevant for all artists&quot; Jenova Chen 
&quot;Most designers, operate largely by intuition and instinct.&quot;
A game is a “system fo meaning” - related to me wanting to make signs all the ay down, even to those parts that the public won’t see, because I am a human being and it helps me.”
Bickmore and Pickard - Come back to them later when they say that human expectation in a virtual agent is so high, it must be tempered to a certain degree - controlled by the author and context of the work (in chapter 2).
Main source for autocosmics are for simplistic things - I.e. movement
Expressive AI looks at authorship. This is important. AI becomes &quot;an artiface built by authors in order to communicate a constellation of ideas and experiences to an audience&quot;
Always designed by hand iteratively, by human beings. She is all over hand-authoring.
A + C  - Points out that movement helps define characters in the most basic way
NWF - the systems are important, not just surface - &quot;a... means of expression for authors&quot;
&quot;games as systems of representation&quot;
An artist engaging in expressive AI practice will be able to build works with a depth, a richness, a sophistication that can't be achieved without this simultaneous focus on meaning making and machine structure. 
Expressive AI practitioners think explicitly about how to provide the
affordances supporting the narration of system behavior&quot;
Miranda July - “we watched this technology being invented and we fee like we should be behind the curtain and there should be no mystery.”
“opaque incoherence with no
determinable relationship between interaction and the
response of the art work”
Computers need rules that are an “interpretation of the world”, not other media.
&quot;A BLEND OF HUMAN AND COMPUTER MEANINGS&quot;
Celia Pearce - Disagree with her about authorial control - authorial control comes from how the systems are framed to you. You are in charge of what is included in the world (partiality)
Not down ai route - I’m an artist - I cannot do that. It cannot just be an engineering issue.
More autocosmics, but better designed (if less complex) systems - their WORKINGS given more context, more exploration of TYPES of systems, what systems can mean. Using the strengths of games to make characters. Where do we place the boundaries of simulation?
“Creating meaningful experiences means understanding the ways a game’s formal system transforms into an experiential one”
A balance of emergence and authored - neither one is better (S+Z) - 
the ultimate value of literature lying in how it explores character and characters (Harvey, 1965). 
oatley - Just as computer simulations can help us get to grips with complex problems such as flying a plane or forecasting the weather, so novels, stories and dramas can help us understand the complexities of social life.” - can games do this as well?
Player stories on the other hand emerge from less moderated game play. They occur when the designer has no strict events for the player to observe in mind and instead allows her to explore a system that, although providing concrete challenges and goals, is less concerned with enforcing rules as to how the events occurring in it should be perceived.
&quot;the intimate machine&quot;
 ‘close encounters of the third kind’ – that is, social encounters with artificial
systems.
powerful player stories form from the delicate balance of players predictic the outcome of their action and being surprised by the right combination of partially random factors.
&quot;game systems aren't really suited to the kind of monologue and deep introspection that prose offered to a writer like Marcel Proust. Instead, games tend to opt for symbolism: embodying whole themes or morals through motifs, set pieces, mechanics and environmental storytelling&quot;

Writing @is the work of art nearest to life itself&quot; - really, Thoreau
- We will need, in our simulations, to choose narrow and deep - different focuses from novels.

            <Comments>I take this further, and perhaps create a representation as a designer of the system; for myself.
Again, I want to play with this idea and build hidden systems that actually function. Hiding some of the drama offstage. This relates to Garrard’s point about animals not just being performative for us, not just being bestand, of having a life of their own, unsupervised.

NEED THESIS FIGS

Paragraph 1 - Pulling it back to Anne: a vignette of the moor - as a characterised place, patrolled by Gravitas. The fate of Anne: driven from her home, the actions of nature have overcome her. The role of women once they have had children - a loss of agency, a fallback into the old superstitions, the old world. The story of her leaving.The new world that she dreamed of (that she would never get) rapidly recedes. Her rituals have not helped her. GRAVITAS, the character, has got her. 


The beest is an afterthought: why worry about something that is not alive. Except it is, irrevocably, alive. It is for the user, the subscryber, to carry on: to discover its life, what it says about Anne and itself - the traumas inflicted, the pathological relationship that is a revelation of her personal response to a particular age. She worked it so hard it was amputated below the ‘waist’ - can die. It confuses Anne and the subscryber - carries on doing rituals. Gets more and more machinelike - hints of its personality coming through. It as the moor, as an environment to traverse, finding buried hints of Anne’s work. Reflects the topology of her mind - the moor and her past reflected. It reflects her pathologies - examples from its body. It was not the beast she wanted it to be - it is most definitely a character, one that is revealed through environmental techniques. Where are the boundaries of character in masterbeast? How she 'Views' things is always contingent.


Paragraph 2 - A summary of the argument that I have led through. 

Problem: A specific problem of character (creating computational characters that are both computational and resonant: that start to overcome those problems already presented. Traditional methods are struggling. An issue of balance. The centrality of computation - moving away from illusionist models of interactivity towards an engagement with that illusive objective of comp-art - making the comp itself meaningful. strong AI is not the general pursuit of artists. Why this problem at all? Why not lesser characters in games? Re-emphasise argument from chapter 2.1.

Approach: A reconceptualisation of the problem of character, resonance etc. Itself as problem of the way that the human mind/body engages with narrative actions. A way to look more broadly at the problem with conceptual and practical foundation; beyond strict aesthetic models.. Autocosmic is a postclassical amalgamation of theoretical positions applied to a practical methodology/a way to summarise multiple positions that privilege imagination/what David Herman calls 'the nexus of narrative and mind'. Not a new aesthetic theory, but a unique drawing-together. Drawing on lots of different things (from across thesis) and applied to a specific type of art: narrative computational art. Autocosmics gives the artist a consistent and theoretically sound way to look beyond their discipline not just in terms of subject matter - but to reinvent the methods of production in their artform itself. A general approach to this specific problem. It is ‘prescriptive’ in Koenitz’s ontology - it says how we might do things. Jocelyn Spence on pg.14 - talk about boundaries betwen art and life (for conc) - between belief and non-belief. Bogost 2009 points out the thinness between aesthetic distance and immersion - that thinness, and muddling, or real and irreal is important to engaging with the work.Builds on LOTS of people saying divides between real and imagined, fact and fiction, believed and not believed, are very thin/contingent. Models outside the arts of reception/engagement are worthwhile models for inside as well.  &quot;From birth, therefore, the human being is concerned with the problem of the relationship between what is objectively perceived and what is subjectively conceived”. Deleuze and Guattari use the terms &quot;rhizome&quot; and &quot;rhizomatic&quot; to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. My work. “ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.”  talking about the mutational, parasitic nature of posthumanist thought - resists hegemony, one way of thinking - always changing, always crossing borders. Really, the autocosmic is an invective TO cross borders, and nothing else. 'Developments in aesthetic appreciation that extend to ordinary life and activity'. Mention Berleant, and how autocosmics builds on his ideas.

My Work: Applying one particular autocosmic lens to the problem: looking for methodologies for character development and reception beyond traditional models.Redefine what characters are by looking at models of ‘personable systems’ outside of traditional models. Using the history of human beings engagement with enviro-as-personified to create an autocosmic approach that suits the enviro-centric nature of comp narratives: character-as-environment. Treat comp chars as environments to traverse, to work, to explore and uncover. A new metaphor for using existing technical approaches to frame what is being built, on an artistic level, differently . 


Paragraph 3 - Conclusions and strengths


1. General conclusions: A fascinating exploration of a particular problem, exciting direction and successful artistic project. It was a chance to challenge myself, to think more broadly about this task at hand (again a quick history of my practice) - move my practice in a new direction. Learnt a lot as a programmer, a narrative artist and a theorist. Definitely a unique contribution to knowledge.

2. Looking at the objectives I set myself in 1.3: have I reached them? Is it resonant? &quot;On the other side, the concept of dramatically or narratively interesting is more problematic. In general, there is a large variety of criteria to qualify a narrative or drama as interesting: causality, unity of action, suspense, confict, etc. Measuring the quality of the narrative experience according to such criteria is always sensitive because no consensus exists regarding which criteria are necessary and suffcient to state that a narrative is an interesting narrative. &quot; Refer to the MWM study.  roth and koenitz talking about user research - both quantitative and qualitative. Bottom-up and top-down. A character that delighted people, that was seen as complex and alive, but which resonated through its computation - about the various themes of the work. Value as an interpretation tool in Museums. Does it strike the comp/res balance? 
Can be used for interpretation, not just to solve a fuzzy artistic problem: &quot;interpretation research suggests that providing enjoyable, satisfying, and engaging experiences lays a firm foundation for promoting environmental attitudes and improving the likelihood that visitors will adopt pro-environmental behaviors (Farmer, Knapp, &amp; Benton, 2007; Powell &amp; Ham, 2008)&quot; - &quot;a successful interpretation should also enable the visitors to make their own constructions of the past.&quot; - Kidd 2015 - the use of empathy and affective turn in museums. The effects of experience-taking can be harnessed and directed toward such positive ends as increasing civic engagement and reducing prejudice and stereotyping. “ - 'IDN' for change - talking about 'serious games' - not just about entertainment. Importance of for its multiple perspectives, seeing consequences of actions etc. He says that some topics require it. &quot;attention and satisfaction are positively related to immersion design features in exhibits. Both visitor stay-time and enjoyment were increased through immersion exhibits (Shettel-Neuber, 1988; Wineman, Piper, &amp; Maple, 1996). Immersion exhibits seem to enhance learning and pleasure (Bitgood et al., 1990; Harvey, Loomis, Bell, &amp; Marino, 1998; Ogden, Linburg, &amp; Maple, 1993).&quot; - Tavernise and Bertacchini - &quot;the attention to numbers and letters in a universe as flat as the page of a book represses the natural human skill of 3D thinking&quot; - emotions created to promote political and social change. (cog sci in env crit) - Copplestone points out that game desiners see &quot;the past as systems, interactions, agency and multilinear narratives&quot; - whereas historians see it as linear narratives. - &quot;Nature centers, museums, zoos, and other exhibit-based institutions need to sustain or increase visitation for economic viability.&quot; (pennisi et al) - “video games is a kind of literacy. Not the literacy that helps us read books or write term papers, but the kind of literacy that helps us make or critique the systems we live in” - Copplestone - &quot;exploring and playing with ideology the point of the rhetoric, rather than a product of it.&quot; - 'Interact' - &quot;Storytelling and narration have played a significant role in Holocaust education&quot; - Copplestone - &quot;the media forms we have been using and the tools we have created for capturing and communicating the past have often required remediation and reduction into forms whose internal affordances do not necessarily natively support these outcomes.&quot; - 'important to have an experience rather than understand a set of ideas efficiently' - says that games/systems are useful for this as well. &quot;t makes the difference between a mere virtual repository of digitalized cultural artefacts and an authentic, immersive virtual experience.&quot; Unexpected responses coming out of my studies… Janet Murray - do I have “dramatic agency through expressive enactment”?

3. Might help more broadly. &quot;widely accepted, generalized conventions are still elusive&quot; (as to how to do IDN). Perhaps this will help. Kpoenitz already identifies it. ‘Char-as-enviro’ is just one particular approach. koenitz sees games as a narrative avant-garde. It doesn't compare well to other forms. They are not the only model. Therefore autocosmics will help as it does not privilege any model: it is a stance, in Dennett’s sense. Not meaning it to be the way IDN should be done. Points the way to a deep interdisciplinarity. Looking further afield in esoteric places certainly was refreshing, helped me find a new approach. A new way to think about characterisation, a new way to think about personhood, building on work in other fields. &quot;a narrative does not have to have humans in it - just persons&quot; - informs and changes the ancient narrative compulsion in humans in new ways.&quot;new ‘strange’ narratives which challenge human exceptionalism” -  &quot;the humanoid robot has been described as “the Grail” of robotics and the pursuit of this goal leads some people to create robots that appear almost indistinguishable from humans&quot; - not working. The &quot;overtly other&quot; - perhaps this is the best way to go, rather than trying to pursue human commonality.Character as environment is somewhere between a metaphor and a mimetic representation of a person. And systemic. Expand, rather than flatten, the ontology. Not sure I advocate getting rid of the hierachy. &quot;an untapped opportunity for the design and analysis of IDNs&quot; - Ryan, Foote, and Azaryahu remind their readers that a geographic approach to narratology encourages “convergence,” or a unique interdisciplinary approach to the human spatial experience.  As Penny notes, the goal of the artist is more often not to generalise, but rather to provide a specific solution that works within a particular context (25).. Philsoophy can “produce new ways of looking at things, ways of thinking about things, ways of framing the questions, ways of seeing what is important and why.”  -  One of Bogost’s ‘&quot;philosophical objects&quot;. - &quot;the coming together of hardware, flesh and audiovisuals&quot; (it was this, as well as an art project). The role of the systemic. &quot;formal systems for describing communicative activities&quot; - Marenko’s new animism (in tech) - the “enchantment of technology” (Gell, 1992) - “simultaneous animate and inanimate” - humans using autocosmics in combination with systemic tech, &quot;inorganic vitalism&quot; - “full of things that react, respond, and modify themselves according to algorithmic modulations”.

SEE APPENDIX 5

Paragraph 4 - Weaknesses

PROBLEM: Is autocosmics a redundant term? Isn’t it just another term for the postclassical, postmodern ‘complication’ of traditional disciplines, 'active involvement in the appreciative process' . Part of the same movement that modern art came from (Magritte, questions the boundaries between reality and art, objet trouve, surrealists using freudian psychoanalysis,  Particularly Duchamp, and the ‘Domain Of Images’, pop art (elevating things beyond traditional aesthetics), “event art”, Morris thinks, a return to ritualistic roots, &quot;the artefact was no more&quot;, &quot;joyfully destroying traditional art&quot; ) - BUT was often conceptual rather than narrative, and not really methodological. 'traditional separation' between art and life had been breached - audiences now had to be involved in art's consturction, not just contemplate it. This is different from autocosmics.What distinguishes autocosmics from that far more general movement? It is part of it, to be sure – a muddying of aesthetic traditions. It doesn’t have the same political angle (I’ve mentioned this). Perhaps I don’t need it – though I think it is different from Duchamp’s etc. Viewpoint which tried to bring art into everyday life. It is not concerned with removing fictionality, but rather A WAY OF MAKING REGULAR ART. Relies on cognitive science a lot more, recent discoveries. Autocosmics takes these findings and applies them to the practice of artmaking. Ppl may have understood this for some time, but it is formalised now. To do with how we RESPOND to the world and to art. Artists can say ‘there are utilities in taking lessons from how ppl engage with the real world, not to make a political point necessarily, but to make better (more resonant) art.’ Particularl in compart. New terms such as ‘autocosmic’ and ‘resonance’ are problematic - fudging together several disciplines. &quot;the highly specific nature of particular projects often make it difficult to identify generalizable conventions.&quot; - I don't give generalizable conventions, nor do I think they exist, necessarily. Ryan says that hard cognitive science isn't yet teaching us that much about the state inside the brain during reading - very murky, or just confirming what we already knew. We don't yet know the true 'science', at neuron-level, of what is happening. Limits of cognitive narratology. Not about exploring the brain - just pointing to another way to think of its complexity. Not about prioritising the brain, either (Ryan) - &quot;for many researchers a story can be a representation that never leave the mind of the subject&quot; - Caracciolo - &quot;Neuroscience is still in its infancy&quot; - a methodology rather than a grand theory. Not interested in what narrative is, but what narrative practise entails - it goes beyond traditional, 'tellable' narrative structures that Ryan loves. &quot;dominant models that marginalize knowledge of alternatives &quot;. &quot;a considerable risk of miscommunication&quot; between these fields. (Koenitz). Marie-Laure Ryan - &quot;problematic relation&quot; between narratology and cognitive science. &quot;when professional readers of literature get excited about certain ideas, they will usually find what they are looking for, and texts will offer little resistance&quot; - weakness of autocosmics. Definition of narrative not important. Bogost - &quot;are they really stories, when they are really environments?&quot; - A more inclusive model of narrative - and a broader conception of narrativity”. Frameworks can be 'prescriptive' (do it this way) or 'desriptive (it is done this way). Which am I? (Koenitz). &quot;being on the margins in relation to other, more established traditions and disciplines&quot; &quot;In other words, the goal is to create a kind of boundary object [7] that might sit at the intersection of HCI and theater and performance studies.&quot; - Like caraciolo - not trying to make a 'systematic' theory of narrative. - As with caraciolo - yes, a metaphor, but one that has some grounding in challenging dualism. &quot;transposing the concept of narrative to other fields of study without diluting its terminological precision&quot; - Agree with machidon that it needs &quot;a synergy of efforts&quot; - Calleja (2013) - if everything is narrative, nothing is (Koenitz reiterates this point in entry) - BUT REMEMBER I AM LESS INTERESTED IN DEFINITIONS OF NARRATIVE - NARRATIVITY IS FINE. I don't care about being called a 'storyteller' - the 'protostory' in the system. Maybe I am closer to Frasca's definition of simulation, rather than 'narrative' - but the division of the terms seem unnecessary when oriented to postclassical communication/experiential/phenomenological auspices. The structure of the prompting experience matters less. Ryan thinks cognitive narratology will be more interested on the level of neurons. What Ryan calls the &quot;pragmatics&quot; of narrative - how narrative is used. Only &quot;recently discovered&quot;. But then, in his 'Carpentry', he sees that metaphors can be productive without being the thing themself. Mine is a methodological metaphor - a carpentry in the truest sense. What is the resolution of Bogost's 'units'? The scale of a character? - Koenitz - &quot;Authors of traditional forms of narrative can rely on a rich body of design conventions for structuring and presenting narrative material&quot; - &quot;games barely have a few decades of experimentation under their belt &quot; Maybe, to tell good interactive stories, we need to be LESS interested in formal narrative - help us reconfigure what narrative is. In conclusion - my approach is Formalist, in a way (though very unprescriptive) - KEogh wouldn't like it. The formal issues need to be addressed because they are fundamental to the struggle. &quot;while AI models tend to be formal descriptions of concrete technical implementations, most narratological frameworks in the humanities are abstract, aiming to identify the essence of narrative, rather than any particular case.&quot; &quot; it is doubtful that there is one component of the mind that can satisfy all the various roles attributed to imagination (Kind 2013)&quot;. The standford imagination entry shows that there are just too many ways to look at imagination. I'm not interested in the taxonomies? The taxonomies are less important to me. even the ones that try to &quot;carve imaginings at their joints&quot; - they are matters of degree. &quot;Quarantining gives way to contagion when imagined content ends up playing a direct role in actual attitudes and behavior (see also Gendler 2008a, 2008b)&quot;. The stuff from 3.2 about belief - do we need a new term? (from stanford philosophy imagination article) Well, possibly not. Overly ‘.simplistic - challenge of character has already been approached, just not ‘perfectly’. &quot; Doggett and Egan argue that during immersive episodes, pretense behaviors can be directly motivated by imagination. In response to these challenges, philosophers typically accept that imagination can have a guidance or stage-setting role in motivating behaviors, but reject that it directly outputs to action-generation system (Van Leeuwen 2009; O’Brien 2005; Funkhouser &amp; Spaulding 2009; Everson 2007; Kind 2011; Currie &amp; Ravenscroft 2002).&quot; Have I focussed too much on delineated autocosmics, and not enough on my methodology? Perhaps.

PROBLEM: Not a very efficient way to go about building a new approach to AI. Steep learning curve, I was ‘reinventing the wheel a lot’, a lot of exploration and learning of ideas that are pretty standard in  CS. I had to build so much ‘groundwork’ - buil;ding AI and animation systems from scratch. Perhaps should have used off-the-shelf methods. But I came to this as an artist approaching these ideas, working them through - helped me see a new approach. I needed to go through this. And also gain the skills and literacy that would allow me to try things differently. Waylaid by personal challenge to go graphical. Felt more like puppeteering sometimes. Developing theories as making it - higgeldy piggeldy - could benefit from starting over again. But this is always the way - I was striking off in a new direction. Very ‘organic’ and exploratory - no fixed idea from the start. This was sometimes a problem - wasted time on experiments. Didn't start off that way – how related to original plan. Autocosmics was evolving as I made it, as well. Koenitz' ASAPS work - not necessarily a good idea to build your own tools, as I did? Not sure it is a good idea to formalise creative process - he talks about &quot;need for experimentation&quot; - Ben Gammon - using text in interactive exhibits not good - good to give them before or after?Certainly overambitious. Too many features, already massively cut down, too many routes into AI, too many tempting problems. An ongoing issue for me. Trimmed and cut - part of the problem of it being a multi-year project. Something to watch in future work, and set myself boundaries. Balancing the complexity of the system - &quot;undesirable&quot; emergence arising from overly complex systems (Harvey Smith, 3002, in Tronstad). Emergence and technical complexity are not naturally better. Weaknesses of systemic approach: &quot;ambivalent appropriation of cybernetics by theorists ever since speak to the difficulty— and likely impossibility— of reconciling humans, animals, machines, and societies into a consistent, coherent, or unified intellectual program.&quot; - can't use it for everything. All the prototypes I made - crying/liquid engine, the prototype of the moleherd. Vocal engine etc. Physics-based interaction (what other stuff from prototypes?) artificiality of the signup process.Why did I make it installation art? If I’d had time, more prototyping. Problems with MR. Difficult to use touchscreen/voice activation. Exhibition problems - timespan, attention span, access - came from inexperience - needs more research. Can people come back to see it? This is part of my new challenges - moving into digital heritage and mixed reality exhibitions. The dynamic is a bit awkward - have to come back and see it. Is it OK for people to get only a tiny sliver of it - for the group to have the entire experience, even if the individual doesn’t have acess to it? THis is an interesting idea. Too much writing in HK - too complex a story. Too much to read up front? Difficulty of returning to/engaging with installation experience , the relatively short and shallow audience engagement with sited digital heritage interpretation (Haywood and Cairns). To get the benefits of the original plan without worrying about adapting for individual machines. Controlling hardware. Hugely technically challenging - learning a huge amount in a short amount of time. A personal challenge to use new tech. - a mess of systems barely held together - an experiment. GM starting to struggle with the amount of code. doing it all myself. still lots of bugs. Exhibiting difficult games - problems with showing, with audience expectation, with how to overcome biases as to what a digital experience should be like. - &quot;The setting and context has to be differentiated. &quot; - &quot;Create a space that encourages respect&quot; - I think I did this. - &quot;Putting a game in a tent, creating its own distinct space&quot; - overlapping with exhibition design. &quot;We can learn from other fields&quot; - &quot;it can be a real challenge to make space for games that require a long time to come to terms with&quot; - &quot;create a distinct, darker, private-feeling area&quot; - Talking about posture. Light levels. &quot;Putting games in a room with books and pictures and other static objects, to encourage a different mode of looking&quot; - &quot;Creating a space very separate from the world at large, that takes effort to get to, with a longer duration that encourages attention to the work and discussion between visitors&quot; - Benford's draws on the challenges of using technology for narrative or immersive experiences. Different levels of engagement with project. Necessarily a problem? “Hidden influences (e.g. internal state) is an obstacle for making fun AI” - therefore make hidden influences uncoverable - like caves beneath a landscape. But cannot ‘vivisect’ a character too much. Creature is an opaque system - patterns are not necessarily divinable, or are divinable in different ways, from how they are laid out explicitly in book - It’s not human? Really, that’s the real goal - resonant computational characters where the computation goes into ‘human’ traits. I agree that in a way I have dodged the question - though most sensible practitioners do this, trying to compute human-adjacent elements of narratives. Also the post-humanism argument - we are changing what we think of as a character, as a person. I wanted to see if there was another approach to the classical agent model, rather than a mere proxy. &quot;We see the human mind as the only one worth emulating&quot;

PROBLEM: My studies of how I met my objectives are limited. Unable to do full study with finished product due to time constraints. In Ryan’s terms, this thesis is more speculative than experimental. This is often seen as a problem.  Caraciolo, on embodiement, wants to look at empirical research as further work.  Not able to test the full suite (HK + MB) until after I had written my thesis. BUT the MWM study did include the HK interactive dynamic, much of the creature’s personality: even without the full experience had the desired response. However might the full experience complicate people’s responses? Remains to be seen. Needs more testing. Me as my own audience - having a response to the creature during testing, explored in 3.4. Also, don’t always need to play the thing: (Brenda Romero, in Mattie Brice). Ryan - difference between narratology and cognitive science - one is experimental, one is not - mine has not been that experimental - some user studies - perhaps need to go further - but is that my interest as an artist? . Ryan doesn't think it is a good idea to do lots of experiments. Ryan says 'bottom-up approaches based on self-examination' when it comes to defining narrative/character. Will probably do more studies afterwards (see below). Didn’t get to test how the subtleties in its expressions, the tiny hints of its body, can be guided by the HK.


PROBLEM: Virtual environments, while perhaps better examples of computational resonance than computational characters, are not perfect, and still. Bogost’s ‘Potemkin Villages’. &quot;For what it is, Andromeda was brilliant pulpy fun. But it seems to be the latest in a line of recent games that struggle to give meaning to the vastness of their open spaces.&quot; My Skyrim field study revealed plenty that was less than - quotes from my diary - “ The Radiant AI is easy to interrogate into inadequacy - watching a deer on the shoreline near Riverwood, I started to see the rough edges of its animation, the planar weirdness of its stance, the repetition.” “Shallow authorship” of the world. Library of Babel (a philosophical absurdity), Elite: Dangerous, No Man’s Sky. Depth as well as breadth. “10,000 bowls of oatmeal problem” by Kate Compton. Tanya X. Short’s search for ‘meaning’ in procedurality. Manovich - &quot;computer spaces have a long way to go&quot;.  “The games that employ animals as characters, it might be said, are employing them in a shallow manner; as leitmotifs rather than as individuals, and with little cognitive depth beyond that which suits that imperative of the limited design.” But my approach is also a way to improve videogame environements. It’s a new way to think, see and do. &quot; buildings become glorified cardboard cut outs rather than locations to explore&quot;. This idea he puts forward that virtual space is often not space-as-a-medium, not &quot;systemic space&quot; and interrelational, but just separate things arranged near each other, unrelated - games don't do space REALLY REALLY well - autocosmics will be useful not just for character-building, but spacebuilding as well (in conclusion) - away from ‘timeless’ ideals of landscape (Garrard)). &quot;What artistic and theoretical tradtions can the designers of navigable spaces draw upon to make them more interesting?&quot; - painting, architecture and CHARACTER DESIGN - Patrick Lindsey #2 (Immersion Fallacy - spaces in games aren't always the best - &quot;The city is populated, but not alive&quot; - architecutre makes no sense, b/c of lack of time to think about how a city works, or too large a scale. &quot;a lack of believability and consistency” - ---Last Seed, 18th, 4E 201-— The wolf kills the deer, but does not stop to eat it; it has fulfilled its purpose. It is only meant as wallpaper to the human (or near-human) activity. For him (bogost) in alien phenomenology, in order to understand how things work must go beyond language - build systems. - Often “little mor than cardboard cutouts” (Inderwildli) - the cities are bad because cities are LANDSCAPES DEFINED BY CHARACTER. - &quot;However, they are often used uncritically: space is just a container for something else, whether as a setting for a story or as a field for gameplay. &quot; Champion identifies similar problems in 'Cultural Turing Test' - virtual worlds are not cultural spaces (more difficult to simulate human,l rather than natural, stuff' - focus on Marco Polo projkect which explores social ideas. - They &quot;looked&quot; good, but were &quot;desolate places&quot; - &quot;no way to participate&quot; in the urban landscape as a landscape Hayot and Wesp 2009 - Still not that great… “The shallowness of Morrowind’s ornamentation emphasises its fictional nature, thus compromising its believability as fiction.” (Strik) - &quot;we are constantly presented with games that take those ideas, the product of a decades-long conversation, as immutable received wisdom.&quot; “In many modern games the world does not change to support the narrative, which is regrettable given the potential impact of doing it.” Tom (GS) - wanted more of a complex world - “more freedom to examine items or objects”. Saw it as “quite static” for #3 - the environments work like Potemkin villages.(Bogost) - In fact, the fact that striated digital space is easier to hide and 'make smooth' than striated character is probably down to how much we chunk, reduce, and PAY LESS ATTENTION to space. In asking people to pay *more* attention to space, we might be breaking that. - (in skyrim study, ecosystems still skin-deep. Improved by mods, Tiny touches: The breath coming out of my character's nose. The difference between worlddfilledness (Having lots to do) and worldliness (having the social structures and other elements ofo a real (if fictiona;) world) (Champion). “Does this kind of deep detail reinforce and support the overall art and design direction for the entire world? Sure, the various tree bark and rock surfaces can be detailed to such a degree that individual clumps of lichen can now be articulated, shaded, and lit – but to what purpose? In this case, is the world presented about stopping and pondering nature, savoring a detail level that has moss growing from antipodean directions to the sun? Or is the game all about getting the player to the next joy trigger as smoothly and deftly as possible, with just enough detail to keep the focal beats strung together? Are both extremes to be accommodated, if not equally appeased? “ Work also needs to be done (Champion in Applying Game Design) on improvng environment design and game goals to foreground the background more effectively. &quot;mazes rather real-world spaces&quot; for shooters - spaces correlated between what they are as places and how they function p.24 - sometimes different worlds, sometimes a contiguous space - often FEEL disconnected.He critiques digital place - the platial relationships are rarely considered beyond military strategy. &quot;To approximate reality requires settings for social transactions that are location specific and task specific.&quot; (Champion) He was writing quite a while ago about digital place - this is starting to change now. &quot;emerging technologies are implicated in and by natural systems. Most mainstream games, for instance, offer game environments as simplistic vehicles for graphical spectacle or extractive resource management.&quot; &quot;he former encourages a sense of wonder and artistic appreciation, but threatens to relegate the environment to pictorial backdrop; the latter allows the environment to move beyond mere setting or scenery by inviting interaction, yet often constrains gameplay to the instrumentalization of nature.&quot; Playing with the past - Talks about how STATIC a lot of virtual environments are - for conclusion. Bruce Janz - He says we rarely &quot;tarry&quot; in digital places. Need to balance &quot;constant engagement&quot; &quot;it is all architecture, no life forms. For stage sets, however perfect, do not tell us much about how people lived there.&quot; I think knole points a way forward. &quot;they are generally used as showcases for technology rather than to reveal the views and beliefs of the owners of that culture.&quot;  Manovich navigable space pg. 13 - still in the early stages of virtual space.


Paragraph 5 - Next steps.

The project itself: Want to undertake more studies, more findings: tour it more, with different types of audiences: try and set up the ‘ideal’ relationship, people coming back again and again.  
“ Less effective systems will be little more than a fleeting and amusing novelty, but the real interest – and the real revolution – will come when interaction sessions are cumlative in their effect so that progressive and long-term ‘relationships’ can develop between the system and the user (Frude, 1987, 1989, 1991)” Perhaps work up the Awlbatch prototype a bit more. A full study with the entire Housekeeping. &quot;huge psychological weight&quot; of games - we spend much longer with them than films.

I want to continue pushing this idea of character-as-environment. More works of art, further ideas: how can we further frame systemic persons as similar to ecosystems, and use our engagement with ecosystems to frame our engagements with systemic artificial persons? How else is our relationships with persons ‘environmental’ and all that entails - exploratory, spatial etc. He really wants to move away from the character, but we cannot. needs to talk about Ryan's conception - move out into what characters, what types of narratives, might be possible or desirable. How treating things as persons, of creating computational experiences that allow you interact with places as persons might have benefits beyond… Starting to engage with these post-humanist ideas of redefining subjecthood, personhood, and looking at networks and systemic relationships - where do the persons come in? Part of ‘narratology beyond the human’. How can narrative practice, particularly comp-art, stand up to engaging with “supra-individual phenomena”. &quot;biological body as a system open to the environment in which it resides&quot;. Different ‘punctualisations’ - where else can we redraw the lines of character? A story of a human through their microbiology? Is that still a character-driven story? Who are the characters in these new, systemic narratives? It becomes about changing what a character can be, rather than fitting comp-art to old, restrictive ideas of character.systems biology and symbiogenesis says no such thing as sovereign entities - just systems and their environments - at all sorts of scales, from human up and down - using this to redefine models of how to build representational systems of persons might help us to use comp-art to represent persons - changing the 'scale' of personhood to a larger TYPE of system that we already imaginatively and socially engage with - changing the imaginative focus of person-led narratives. More work to do on these scales, on where we draw the lines of personhood, and what kind of computational narratives you could tell with such a focus. &quot;the continuing debate in human (and physical) geography regarding the necessity of scale itself&quot; - actor network theory. Removing scale and divides between human/non-human, conscious/unconscious I don't want to remove scale, but certainly play with it. Tilley - THe &quot;scale of analysis&quot; - where are the boundaries of the place we are talking about? For conclusion - symbiogenesis in Margulis - new lifeforms arise from the symbiogenesis of previously separate systems - can't go into it too much, but interesting! The scale of life, of personhood... Barbieri (theoretical biologist) -(Nayar on him) &quot;all organisms are networks and not sovereign, autonomous entities&quot; - Symbiogenesis is basically the biological discipline that concerns itself with scales of life (where do we draw the lines for life) - and does this mean we can play with where we draw the lines for personhood, especially when using a format (comp-art) that privileges networks and &quot;systems biology&quot; (Nayar) - Gilbert calls it &quot;the permeable I&quot; - no &quot;self-contained I&quot;. The creature had definite boundaries, but open it up. &quot;bodies are simultaneously open and closed&quot; - &quot;not a self-contained, bounded entity&quot; - Relating it to similar studies in consciousness studies - Alterity = the degree of separation of an entity from its environment. Alterity, obviously, in posthumanism, is to a lesser or more complicated extent. &quot;in which snese is a person an individual when they are made up of many non-human organisms and are also formed of shifting relationships?&quot; Caraciolo - does character HAVE to be human-like? &quot;unsettle the metaphysical primacy of the human&quot;. “our image of the world has to become one in which processes predominate and human actors disappear” (1996: 554)&quot;. &quot;The broad view espoused by cybernetics is that living systems are complex, adaptive control systems engaged in circular relations with their environments.&quot; - where is the boundaries between enviro and libing systems? Part of systems art.Might be that some people don't need characters as much (CRIT) - literature on anthropomorphism shows a trend for some people but not others. Relate to Bogost - a person can be a system, rather than a monolith IN a system. Opens up much larger questions on coherence and entities in a system. Are characters 'tokens' or 'quasi-objects' within a system. Not entirely wedded to actor network theory, but some of its ideas are interesting. creating characters from bundles of processes - do we do the same? Actually going back to a formalist approach - characters not as perdurant, but as atomic/structural. Characters as perdurant, emergent structures in the noise. New cybernetics bridges 'micro/macro gap' - less distinction between levels of systems (conclusions) and it shows that information as constructed and reconstructed by the individual, and is 'observer-dependent' - Felix Geyer and Hans van der Zouwen. Emergence in a system from components - punctualisation - all actors are made up of smaller actors. Characterts and people are hiccups, agglomerations, arbitrary environments. The lice in our eyebrows.Doesn’t every environment have its environment? - Hofstader, 545 - “morphogenesis” - “intercellular communication on a local level give rise to large-scale, global structures and organisations” - Humans as a “chunked model” - “we sacrifice dereminism for simplicity” - Fundamentally - on what level of the universe (as an isomorphism of it) are we trying to encode characterisation? &quot;Some biologists influenced by cybernetic concepts (Maturana and Varela, 1980; Varela, 1979; Atlan, 1979) realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. &quot; In conclusion: as I said in CHapter 2, don't want to abandon agent approach entirely. Courting the ancient agency bias of human beings. Trying to reconcile that with the difficult of ACTUAL agency. Can it be detached from its mystical, religious, animist associations? Could we build environmental characters that are NOT gods or spirits? Shawn Graham's IF NPC- &quot; Jason Dyer recommended breaking up the Major’s speeches, for, “the sense of discovery in conversation (in this sort of game) needs to be the same as the sense of discovery in exploring an environment.”&quot; John Osborne’s gamasutra article - avoiding character may well be problematic. And characterising systems is unavoidable - not doing it is as much an endorsement of a character-led view as doing it. For conclusion? &quot; blurs the boundary between sub-jectivity and materiality, agency and passivity&quot; Econarratology can definitely help.	 ('Distributed cognition' - inspired by ant hives. Ryan's review of Palmer's work provides an introduction to this.) - Ryan disagrees that places can be agents - a collective mind is different from a singular mind. But I think its a case of frames. While Ryan states (and Palmer agrees) that individual and social minds are different, I believe that the latter can be used to produce a sort of the former through metaphor. Not taking a formalist point of view - not interested in 'character as function' (Propp, in Caraciolo) - as caraciolo states, somewhere between functionalist and mimetic, disregarding the totality of both - an 'econarratology of character'. I don't want to decouple character, remember (Chapter 1), but still interested in 'agencies' (Chapter 2), but still want to stay 'perdurant'. &quot;With environmental presence the individual affects and is affected by the outside world. If there is social presence we affect others in a virtual world. If there is cultural presence we should be able to detect a distinctly situated sense of inhabitation, of social values and behaviors preserved and transmitted through ritual, artefact and inscription.&quot; Running these three together. - we could do this with character-as-enviro. I'm more resistant to the Formalist approach that can be entailed by econarratology (as Caracciolo does)
The &quot;overtly other&quot; - perhaps this is the best way to go, rather than trying to pursue human commonality.
‘the distinction between static settings and dynamic characters’ are less clear (eskenlinen)
In delineating this example of an autocosmic methodology, I am diverging slightly from the post-classical and post-humanist projects I identified in the last section. While I am certainly interested in how econarratology, for example, can ‘probe modes of causal efficacy that are alternative to human agency and subjectivity’	 cite
 - unlike caracciolo, I think environmental thinking can be used for humanesque characters, but I am open to the concept of character being changed along the way.&quot;narrative’s tendency to foregroundhuman protagonists, psychological causality, and human-scale temporality andspatiality&quot;
Do we need to &quot;extricate character from anthropomorphicconceptions&quot;
I'm not sure that we can easily get away from anthropomorphism.
This approach to character is metaphorical, he admits, but that is not a weakness. I also want to pursue this angle.
&quot;How can narrative elevate the nonhuman–material objects, butalso large-scale processes such as globalization or the weather–to the position ofa character? &quot;
Change of focalisation and punctualisation, together.
 In conclusion - my approach is Formalist, in a way (though very unprescriptive) - KEogh wouldn't like it. 
 Does changing the focalisation of computational character in this way help with Bogost’s issue with a lack of systemic focus in character-led narratives by considering characters in the same way that we consider systems: systems not larger than ourselves, but precisely as large as we are?
Depending on which level you focus on, that’s where the character is - punctualisation.
Falstein talks about animals and robots being easier to do.
t’s not human? Really, that’s the real goal - resonant computational characters where the computation goes into ‘human’ traits. I agree that in a way I have dodged the question - though most sensible practitioners do this, trying to compute human-adjacent elements of narratives. Also the post-humanism argument - we are changing what we think of as a character, as a person. I wanted to see if there was another approach to the classical agent model, rather than a mere proxy. &quot;We see the human mind as the only one worth emulating&quot;


Working with museums and digital heritage more: this is in particular something that will really benefit from narrative design work. Incredibly important ways that people build truth, understand themselves and others: char-as-enviro helps in particular here with the focus on environments and the enviros outlasting the humans that constitute them. Greef and Latioli - Many applications, such as culture, are dynamic and therefore static representations are notefficient for portraying them.” The systemics of personhood, and the personhood of systemics, in heritage interp. &quot;Both Gillings and I suggest it is not a lack of realism but a lack of meaningful content which impedes the enjoyment of virtual heritage (Champion 2006).&quot; Janet Murray - IDN as a “cognitive scaffold for increasing our… understanding of complex systems” - &quot;Virtual environments can also present ideas, objects, or techniques difficult to perceive or conceive of in real-world form, or in conventional media.&quot;

Exploring site-specificity, installation work, augmented virtuality and natural interfaces more as well. Further blurring the lines between life and art. The ‘computational’ itself.  muddying the boundaries further between aesthetic and non-aesthetic, real life and art. Traditionally the preserve of conceptual arts. Those as NARRATIVE tools - how do we experience fictional narratives differently when our bodies are involved at more refined levels? An autocosmic take on these issues. &quot;Taste, touch, and smell are far less developed senses, and they do not seem to have any narrative potential&quot;. Just the start of addressing these issues.

Further project ideas:  Smaller projects, not requiring so much prep. Making ecocritical works (with heritage places) - place as personhood. Works that allow you to experience systemic personhood directly, that plays with what that means - either as videogames, installations or otherwise. Ideas -  Applying territory mechaics to interpersonal relationships (castles and an argument in a relationship) - navigate an argument as a space between two almost-impregnable castles. Also trying to improve digital enviro design, as well, after weaknesses noted above. THe ‘more-than-human’ or ‘post-human narratological’ perspective digitally as well - new types of character, away from computational rhetoric that is anthropomorphising - who already does this?  &quot;It can therefore be said that many games have been designed not to need AI. For the academic who wants to build interesting AI for an in-game role, the best might therefore be to create new game designs that start from the existence of the AI&quot; - &quot;ecocritics and game designers may find an increasingly ripe source for analysis in the worlds constructed in videogames.&quot; - other way around? In industrial design - spaces that become smart, become animate, become ‘alive’ - this too?  Bogost (Critical Path) talking about not just showing 'human-interest stories', but 'we want to show as much of the system of that situation as we can'. The system becomes the new character, but without the reductiveness or anti-narrative bent that Bogost uses. &quot; is the player character's environment an enemy or obstacle that must be overcome? Or must it be exploited to win? Can videogames help encourage players to develop a more responsible attitude towards the world beyond their screens?&quot; &quot;A different kind of mistake is found in some commercial approaches to virtual worlds. Here, space in video games serves too often as polygon-rich spectacle and “eye candy” that remains largely unused in the actual gameplay. It is time to revise this immature misconception and build new connections along the way for further debate.&quot; Using existing systemic models (OOO, multiple agent architectures) to new metaphorical ends. &quot;games are structurally predisposed toward creating meaningful interaction within artificially intelligent environments, and should be well poised to model dynamics long at the core of ecological thinking—interdependence, limitation, nested organizational scales, flows of energy and biomass, feedback, and so on.&quot; Not just scientific approaches, though. How does one manage coherency - can we push the idea of person to its limits? “Is the world something akin to a principal actor, taking center stage, or rather a mechanism for more complex interaction, in and of itself? Is it merely there as a non-interactive vessel for some other form of gameplay?” (Noah Berry). 

Expand the idea of the autocosmic as well: Other avenues for autocosmic exploration, other issues of computational narrative art: meaningful choice, plot development. More research into the nature of distance/belief - this is key, I think, to the autocosmic, and will reveal some interesting fuzzy boundaries between ‘mundane’ and ‘aesthetic’ experiences. Bolster my defence. &quot;Finally, the nature of fiction, which is a pragmatic issue, has received much more attention from philosophers than from literary narratologists.&quot;  Koenitz workshop - &quot;practitioners continue to push the envelope of interactive narrative forms&quot;. &quot;this perspective has had only a limited impact on the design of interactive digital narratives&quot; - non-western perspective - don't think it necessarily has to be non-western, but rather more wide-reaching - autocosmics provides that. Thon - contemporary narratology has only just begun to address these questions. of what new narrative forms arise, and how they relate to interactivity. Benford interested in taking his model outside of HCI - me too!  Autocosmics is a reification not of a field, but a desire within a field. &quot; This will require more than the standard ethnographic suspension of disbelief. Rather,it will demand-at the very least-the kind of true agnosticism described by Nelson, combined with a willingness to treat xtraordinary experiences as data and take them intoaccount in our theory making&quot; - why does belief matter, to me? &quot;When designing the worlds we play in, future game designers might increasingly be educated in “traditional” elements of landscape design, including ecology and architecture. With this also comes the opportunity for people in different fields to collaborate in shaping the worlds of future video games, radically reshaping both professions in the process.&quot; Janet Murray - we are at a milestone moment now for IDN. Lots to study, lots of practitioners. “Overlaps with other disciplines” - moving out of “siloes” - need new “structural innovations” - “moral physics”

SECTION OBJECTIVE: To explore some of the ways that I have used an autocosmic methodology to bring practises of resonant computational environment, in conjunction with humanity’s historical engagement with place as a systemic person or persons, to create a resonant computational character: ‘character-as-environment’

3.4.1

I have already seen char as enviro in many different places (even if not always called that). Perhaps not surprising given systems-focussed, cybernetic nature of computation and comp-art. Sometimes explicit, sometimes not. Egs in the previous section show how it is coming hand-in-hand with the spatial turn, part of this historical movement.
AI architectures. AI architectures frequently about interaction of different parts (colony architecture, distributed AI (mostly this), ‘multi-agent systems’ (not all make a character or clear ‘entity’), object-oriented programming, SOAR, subsumption architecture, all the way up to BOD). Characters made up of nodes (but not characterised). Often away from real mind models to create functional, practical architectures. I used BOD b/c it was a simple implementation of these ideas, but also informed what I made - made char-as-enviro easier to make. But meant to be experienced in gestalt, not all the little bits. The architecture is supposed, often, to support a singular experience. Cheng’s BOB. Noel Welsh on animism in object-oriented programming. Explains its popularity/perserverence. “nimism provides a theory about why OOP is powerful: its particular style of modularization divides up a program so that animate thinking can be readily applied to any of its parts. Functional programming, on the other hand, provides a model that systematically excludes animism, which might explain why, despite its undeniable theoretical advantages, it has little popularity outside of a small research community.&quot;” Galloway talking about the connections between ‘the structure of ontological systems [about the world] and the structure of the… technologies of post-Fordist capitalism?’ 
In art, lots of environments that are wilful/meant to be interacted with in an animist sense. La Maison Sensible, Penny’s UZUME. One of Champion’s as an example of this. Perhaps, in metaphor, Dear Esther.
Boss characters in videogames. Particularly large and impressive enemies that take up for more of the player's narrative, spatial and strategic attention than other enemies – in some cases, as in Shadow Of The Collosus, becoming 'living levels' in their own right. Sevastopol and the alien as one. Both environments to negotiate themselves (particularly God of War), and interpenetrated with existing environments.Gamasutra and Gameindustry.biz draw attention to them as a ‘test’ of what the player has learned - mostly this is environmental manipulation. In bounded arenas.”Even the shape of the environment bosses lurk in can be a crucial part of their design. “ A videogame boss is both a test and a story. Not a huge amount written on them (using undergrad thesis - focusses on their role as environments). Large size is important. Their ‘lair’ - tied to a particular place that is part of them. Examples of the player being followed through the game by bosses - sinistar, Prince of Persia: double troubl, Portal. The role of the ‘epic’ , the ‘arena’. The biggest focus on a character in mechanical encounter. An intimacy. Bosses &quot;can define a world, give it character and allow players to have a focal point when discussing moments within the game,&quot; says Kynan Pearson, creative director at Bluepoint Games. The mothership in phoenix. Killer Croc. Newman: ‘bosses usually require a more complex strategy’ - the boss is a puzzle, to newman. “Self-contained space” - “character or mechanism”
Examples in the previous section of an ‘econarratological perspective’, that looks at divides of personhood and environment. E.g. Everything - Alan Watts philosophy - An experiment in personhood - in what a character should be. “Tremendous connectedness of everything” About the systematics of life and existence. Cheng creating interlapping characterised systems. Examples from the previous section. 
My autocosmic methodology of ‘character-as-environment’ took a slightly different approach. About interacting with a character like it is an environment (unlike most AI architectures). Not a strict econarratological approach, away from the human/anthropomorphised character, like Cheng/Caracciolo approach. Not about a character interpenetrated with environment, like boss characters, or an environment that bears the memories/imprints of a character/the characters that lived within it. Characterisation not necessarily ‘spread out’ across the environment - just ‘normal’ comp. characters in another shape.
Re-iterate the point of a autocosmic approach to this, and then proceed. It is about building something that is meant to be reacted to in some of the interpersonal, systemic ways that we relate to environments (egs from a variety of places, interdisciplinary).

3.4.2

FIRSTLY: building a character, both mechanically and narratively, as a form of landscape. This correlates to the first part of the last section: how landscapes work as complex interrelations of systems, and how human beings perceive them and navigate them: especially AS characters. This is relatively quick: most obvious, and probably least interesting. Observation and less interaction, in this section.
Creature as the moor: An argument for him being a projection of Anne’s imagination (or perhaps the spyrit of the moor). Many of the features that she talks about on the moor are on the creature (symbolically/topographically) - the heights with the two stones, the moles, the fences that stop them (enclosures) (Awlbatch was going to be in there).  The top of its head is the top of the moor: a place of focus for Anne. The moon’s role. Won’t engage with the moor - only veew it. The creature is a safe space she can manipulate. Nested spaces - creature as a landscape within its ritual space (end with this sentiment).
Creature built to be traversed as a landscape, a PLACE. Gamemaker is typically used for landscapes/boxes. Has an environment, but is not a pathfinder like other AI: it is either there or it is not. It has two zoom levels - at ‘creature -level’ and ‘landscape level’ - must zoom between them to do Anne’s rituals. Some areas are forbidden (taboo areas) - the fences stop you going down to discover its secret. Hair covering - must cut it to uncover secrets (a mess, Anne refers to trees). Anne referring to birds, god’s finger coming down. Crawling/dragging your way across it. Some things are only visible when you are zoomed in. Taking ingredients from it, like a landscape. The burial place of Sarah and Matthew (mentioned in the ballad). Scars left on the landscape by Anne’s doings-  correlate to the recipes, you can see which were used the most, which were most important to her. Tiny movements versus big movements - both are important. Which ‘punctualisation’ you are looking at. Bird’s eye view - she wants. Depunctualisation (a network breaking down and all its components becoming visible) - how does this relate to Anne? To how she treats the creature? the reverse - she treats it as components rather than an emergent whole. Bits are more important than as a whole. Hedier and Simmel - slight movements are just as important as big, expressive movements, albeit in a different way. Games are all about the big movements. Apart from in the environment. Perdurance - it carries on without you. “ Metroid Prime makes the player feel he or she is making a concrete impression on the world while also implying that such world will continue to exist whether or not the player’s character is there [13].” Exploring = getting to know someone. &quot;objects are not digitally simulated as objects-in use, with life histories, with formal or associational traces.&quot; - I'm trying to do this.&quot;Typically the role of place in virtual environments has been as a locator of objects. Yet cultural geographers argue place is more a constrained and malleable container of localised activities, evoking associations of past events and stimulating future tasks.&quot; HOW DOES THIS ALL RELATE TO BEING A PERSON? Players are invested in discovering Dark Souls mysteries because the hints found do not contradict themselves or point to settings not supported by the story. To make it work, attention to detail is essential since the participant will start searching the smallest of the assets for meaning. Susan Bredlau - the body as place - &quot;loci of intimacy and particularity&quot; Intimacy and inhabitance is important here - intimate spaces. It does still react like a person, though. &quot;cognitive overloading (including too many interactive processes for the participant to cope with effectively while immersed within a virtual environment).&quot; - 3.4 again. Helps you to split your attention? Getting lost in landscape is positive - like getting lost in a person... - Vivian sobehack. Navigating around creature (done by waypoints). Often very large setups – entire islands, the rise of the sandbox (esp. For narrative games) – exceptions, though – about where the scale is – Trying to do too much, situating them in a big world. Don't spend a lot of time with characters. A bounded, contained place (microworlds). Backstories and ruined architetures - relying on the importance of characters’ backstories, i.e. events that happened before or outside the main plot: how in the creature? Meredith - videogame archaeology - going down into the worlds of videogames, exploring them (the mystery plot) - but also nature writing? Pespective is that of a bird, Anne's only animal - flying above it, untroubled by it. The Enlightenment 'view' of landscape, the importance of detached 'view' as opposed to labouring with the land, being immersed and involved in it - she hates it. Romanticism coming on after that.
Interconnected Systems and Opacity: Beyond topography. Different body parts/features all interconnected (give some examples?) - all interconnected. What lies under the surface? The internal states. It is opaque. You can only understand it by interacting with it, seeing the systems interconnecting. Creature is a system, but not as simple as she makes it out to be. Getting past her mechanomorphism - how do you do that? The spreading cankers by your touch… I built it up as systems, rather than an individual - it emerged from the systems (bottom-up). MORE OPACITY/LESS EMPHASIS ON INTERACTION - Kahurlathi - properties of virtual objects may be outside the user's manipulation. Stuart's article - Short and Evans on how player's use their models of how games work to underpla y the systems they are working with. THinking it is simple, not knowing what is going on - is part of the problem the opacity? The 'black box' approach? How much access does the player have to the underlying systems?William Gaver, Beaver and Benford 2003.2x wortham papers for transparency. Caves as metaphorical - into the secrets of the mind. The mist at their mouths. The secrets of skyrim buried. How do you dig beneath the surface with the creature? DARK SOULS - &quot;deploying a range of formal techniques and mechanisms designed to arrest the player’s judgment and prevent her from arriving at a stable cosmic understanding&quot; Does this by indistinct boundaries - - sublime as being tied to religious feeling (#3) - showing vistas out of reach, linking the space together in strange ways, seemingly unattainable places. The boundaries between these factors in the total work, the variable “observability” (Costikyan) and “ambiguity” (Anthropy and Clark, 2011) of the “game object” (Aarseth, 2011), are also a productive area of exploration: rather than being a source of capitulation and frustration, an artist can set aside their desire, derived from the field of human-computer interaction, to provide the audience with a gradually complete understanding of the workings of their piece through the interface, and instead use the lack of “direct access to the game’s algorithm under the surface” (Arsenault and Perron) which defines comp-art (Anthropy and Clark) to explore the role of ambiguity, mystery (Ashwell) and the partiality of understanding that is important to artistic and educational engagement with character-led narrative (Kidd, 2017), thus avoiding the forensic reductiveness that plagues current approaches to computational charactr. Perhaps, as in the (admittedly highly metaleptical) work of artist Maurizo Bolognini (1992), where computers passed randomly-generated images to each other without ever displaying them to the audience on an output device, there is space for characters whose representative systems are entirely ‘black boxes’, with no clear blueprint available for their construction, and which serve as narrative expressions of the problems of ‘other minds’ (Wisdom, 1952). The ambiguity and otherness of landscape is permitted. I follow an unnaounced cave in a crevice in a waterfall - you can interrogate the landscape all the way to its edges, iot will make sense. With a determined, designed environment, a game designer can give an environment motivation - to boost our autocosmic assignment of motivation to them anyway - a learned,evolved response. In #3 - the sublime of the unknown game system, of narrative worlds, and our interactions with the sublime natural world (and through nature writing). (Dark Souls and Sublime).
As An Environmental Other: Bown et al - “Communicating with Uzume is similar to pursuing a dialogue without knowing the language of the other: all we can do is explore the other’s gestural language but
the actual meaning is never revealed, never completely decoded, never fully confi rmed. “ Emmanuel Levina's concept of &quot;the face to face&quot; encounter with the other in artistic robotics. not about exploring commonality, but exploring difference, between self and the other. Animals as unknowable systems - the cow. Eleanor Sandry - Ambiguity with robots - don’t try to ‘perfect’ communication. Coming to know a character, epistemologically, in the way we know environment (games). Familiarity through action, through inhabitance. Can we inhabit another person? Macfarlane quotes Barry Lopez (p. 211); “if we attend more closely to something we are less like to act selfishly towards it.” This is part of the HCI desire for intimacy and interdependence that I am seeking, though it has a metaphorical power here as well as the functional, emotionally-manipulative one from HCI. 
The Numinosity Of A Designed Enviro: Enviro that has been built - therefore numinous for our - everything is there for a reasoN! This affects how we relate to it. Everything is important. This idea of allowing lower semiotic resolution: if it is a game environment, how do we work out what is important, and what is not? Can EVERYTHING be impiortant. eople in religion also thought the real world was authored, and everything significant. Look at micro-worlds in AI, for example. &quot;Build microworlds with human significance&quot; - &quot;Oblivion is the victim of its own ambition: it raises the player’s expectations of the world and the characters but is unable to satisfy them.&quot; (T&amp;B) &quot;The dissonance in Oblivion comes from a failure to define the narrative conventions (or internal expectations) of the world and to adhere to them.&quot; (T&amp;B) – too many things to keep track of, the simulation is too large. - Calleja paper - talks about game space as designed, whereas real space is not (other people mentioning this) - but the design questions in real life - patterns emerging that can be exploited (even if not designed) - the belief in the designedness of space. Games have an intelligent designer, and we know this! Can we recapture some of that ambiguity and discovery?In 'wide and deep' simulations, &quot;player expectations are raised to unrealistic levels&quot; Importance of author comes from the fact that a symbolic artefact, as an act of communication, must have an originating communicator. The sense of an &quot;author&quot; &quot;can well be said to be a biological predisposition&quot; - therefore important.
The observation of landscapes, to see how it changes over time: “When we stop thinking about videogames purely in terms of what the player can ‘do’ and start thinking about them in terms of how the player’s ‘looking’ and ‘listening’ is configured, all sorts of experiential encounters become possible that, from a perspective that favours ‘gameplay’, can only ever be considered boring.” The importance of inaction with the creature. What happens when you don’t do anything? Keogh points out that &quot;watching, planning, navigating&quot; is play, is interaction, as well. Choosing NOT to act. &quot;Activity and passivity are not opposites in videogame play but fluctuations in the circuit, and thus […] a new conceptual language is needed to attend to both the operations of nonhuman agency and the human pleasures of lack of agency, of being controlled, of being acted upon. (Giddings &amp; Kennedy, 2008, p. 30)&quot; - finish with - BUT WE DO MAINLY ACT. &quot;The time spent slowly navigating through the game world becomes time for contemplative thought and speculation to the relevance of audio-visual elements. Each new point of focus serves as pieces of additional information that may be added to the player’s mental map. In their totality the player may build a more conclusive or comprehensive picture as to their relationship and significance within the greater narrative context.&quot; The slow pace of this experience is very important. &quot;One does not stop playing a videogame when one is not pressing a button but remains actively and bodily involved in game-play through the senses. “ Witness as an abstract puzzle game that introduces observation of a 'mostly' static enviro. &quot;Observation of the setting must be an essential part of the game.&quot; - you are told very little, even by Anne’s book.“There must be waiting time built in as a fulfilling experience with the natural world, involves more than passively sitting back to be informed and entertained.” just looking - looking is still manipulating - it actually is in my work! There is a usability/narrative point to this as well, demonstrated by the above quote by Garrard. Patience, waiting, the chance of missing things, is part of an interaction with any unpredictable network, and I think it is a worthy artistic pursuit to instil patience, wonder and observation into people’s interaction with non-tool software. Finish by talking about the other spaces of the exhibition. Nicklin - He read Nan Shepherd’s The Living Mountain just after he made Proteus, and says it explains really well that “much more intimate, slower, mindful, less achievement-driven [walking], it really felt quite kindred to what we were trying to do with Proteus.”

3.4.2.1

You don’t just observe, though: you are directed…
Most open-world videogames provide you with a new (foreign) locale and ask you to make it familiar. To map it and figure out how to traverse it. Most open-world videogames ask you to strip these worlds of interestingness and exoticness, to mine them of resources and ‘newness’. 
Real-world weather - tied to the real world: is it just outside the house, or is it in its own ‘realm?’
As he points out, a mixed reality installation mixes the concept of the 'view', a separate representation of thea rtowkr, and immersion in a space. Two different spaces joined by darkness.
 “ the landscape of Tamriel has changed for the player from something that is vast and overwhelming to something manageable, comprehensible and perhaps even pedestrian.”
The reader, like the nature writer, is not in charge of the experience.Animals in videogames - “transforming them from useful objects into characfters”
 You are doing rituals UPON the landscape.#3 - &quot;leave traces of their visits&quot;
Installation - &quot;dense multimedia information spaces&quot; - tied to tyhe design of &quot;virtual navigable spaces&quot; - working directly with space.
Neal Alexander - drawing on Barry Lopez - “an attitude of patient attentiveness”
“&quot;intuitive physical processes&quot; of a natural interface allow the observer's unconscious to connect to the virtual space in a much more intense way than keyboard and mouse - interface is not part of representation, but part of system
&quot;Not surprisingly, most embedded narratives, at present, take the form of detective or conspiracy stories, since these genres help to motivate the player’s active examination of clues and exploration of spaces and provide a rationale for our efforts to reconstruct the narrative of past events.”
Rituals are as old as our social practices, are both socially performed and arbitrated AND cultural AND environmental. Part of a wider system of belief, embedded in time and space, attention required &quot;(the belief that certain actions trigger certain responses at a scale different to the human one&quot; - mythology requires rituals to communicate their message and importance to the wider
Using rituals in games would be good ways to understand other cultures and peoples - as long as the cultural significance and roles of those rituals are well-communicated.
The palliative nature of relationship.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 - real weather - the real weather in game emphasises the connections and disruptions between Anne's little realm and the real world she despises outside.
&quot;real virtuality&quot; Chalmers and Howard (2009)
Creature draws you into this crack.
Talks about Mointain exploiting the disconnect between controls and the controller (i.e. the player) - as with knole, the idea of 'controlling' a character to some end is subverted. 
&quot;rituals... preserve and pass on cultural knowledge&quot;
Must understand the cultureal aspect of rituals to perform them meaningfully as part of an active game.
&quot;Zack Kotzer described it
on Motherboard: Mountain’s like a Tamagotchi.
Except you’re powerless to actually save it.&quot;
Keogh -” reductive, causal ideas of what interaction is” - not always instrumental.
talks about &quot;honourary persons&quot; - animal characters are not a cop out. 
Talking about digital pets, tamagotchis.
The Sims as pets, as animals. - &quot;allowing for acts of dramatic cruelty&quot; against them.
The moon means nothing to her cosmology - but it exists, the real world encroaching into the virtual, and vice-versa.
&quot;Mixed reality environments offer great potential for making that bridge between the here-and-now (physical) and the past/abstract (virtual/digital).&quot;
The rituals are excuses to reveal the creature through their granular components, and in combination, rther than in their results - as elsewhere.
Suggest using cameras, biofeedback, to track participants adherence. Using rul;es to track how they are performing.
sacred vs. profane space (on the creature's body)
games need to &quot;introduce actions that engage the player into strategic relations with other characters and require a construction of the character's mind&quot; How do I do this? How does 'character-as-environment' do this?
Religion in igital game paper - representations of ancient religions, ritual, magic is often 'bricolaged' in games -drawn and mashed and manipulated together.
&quot;you should be able to interact with the environment as much as a local.&quot;
&quot;not just a consequence of being surrounded by a spatial setting but of being engaged in another place&quot;
&quot;social behavior is an important way of transmitting cultural information in relation to artifacts (and externs)&quot;
&quot;an archive that is... manipulated in a very particular way: playful performance&quot;
&quot;a vast global public of consumers who are constantly and voraciously looking for representations and sentiments of mystery, exoticism, esotericism and possibly magic&quot;
&quot;There is growing support for an alternative 4th criterion, that physical space and /or engagement need to address perceptions of appropriate or believable social behaviors (Schuemie et al, 2001). If social behavior is an important way of transmitting cultural
information in relation to artifacts (and externs), then we require some form of seemingly autonomous social agents, be they computer based or other participants.&quot;
&quot;“Not-So-Sacred Quests: Religion, Intertextuality, and Ethics in Video games” by Mark Love focuses first on the predominance of religious imagery and motifs in video games in general but more specifically in a game entitled Oblivion.&quot;
She has what Dennett sees as a &quot;personal religion&quot; or &quot;private religioN&quot; - not a real religion, in that sense, or at least not private as tied to one's own social milleu. &quot;honorary religions&quot; - &quot;spiritual&quot;
&quot; Love suggests that religion is used in video games as a tool, one with many functions. It can be used to accomplish another goal, or it can act as a form of manipulation, or criticize or endorse real world religions. &quot;
&quot;religious activity as a form of game playing and ritual game playing as a form of religion.&quot;
Gerard Hynes - &quot;private to the individual in the first place&quot;
Table of contents for heidelberg shows the range of ways religion is critiqued in games.

Narrative is the content of ritual, for her. (ryan)
From Swamp Dragons - Mary Douglas - Anne is a dirt-rejecting culture.'To reject dirt is to imagine that it can be separated from what is sacred, and to finalize that separation by annihilating pollution from the cosmic order itself.'
Interesting how few games incorporate religion, especially as playing them is so like the religious act.
The recipes don’t do anything - well some of them work, but only because the creature allows it. The contingency between paratext and place - commentary on rationalisation/instrumentalistation of the player.
Using Ritual As Interpersonal Interaction: The denuding of its fur. You hover above it like a bird, then zoom down - lots of parallels between fingers and birds in it. Constantly shifting between larger and smaller views - macro and micro. What affects the micro affects the macro. The environment reacting as a whole (creature) and on a local level. Little AND big movements.
Khandaker - She talks about the expressive potential of acting out actions rather than abstractly dealing with them.
Poole, 2000 - game control schema abstracted from physical actions is &quot;cybernetic dissonance&quot;
&quot; a hybrid of semiotics, actions, and systems—one that can account for both the player’s active and embodied engagement with material form and the player’s sense of presence in the virtual world as integral textual components.&quot; - this is really about MR/VR.
&quot;Impure and defiled, both literally and figuratively, the swamp dragon is uncharismatic but still alive, an ecstatic identification with a beleaguered cosmos. It prevents the idealization of nature or culture, and thereby avoids traditional dualism and its reversal, which Karla Armbruster and Kathleen Wallace have warned us against (Armbruster and Wallace 4). In a political landscape ruled by the sublime, by the “enchantment of distance,” as Rick van Noy has said (van Noy 182-83), the swamp dragon offers the enchantment of proximity and proximity’s curse: a view of the damage to the world that cannot be completely undone. It is a dirt-affirmer and the dirt to be affirmed.&quot;
Based on Swink's ('game feel') model of interactivity.
&quot;. The significance, however, is that this text belongs to neither the virtual nor the actual world but to the cybernetic ebb and flow between the player’s body, the videogame hardware, and audiovisual and haptic representation. &quot;
&quot;Such analysis demands the critic holds onto various worlds and bodies and the tensions between them: the player, the
character, actual hardware, virtual worlds.&quot;
&quot; the interweaving of physical and virtual environments in mixed-reality
performance results in a multiplicity of spaces&quot;
&quot;The hybrid space of the experience is being created moment by moment, through the
participant’s interaction with the physical and virtual environments&quot;
&quot;[s]tructurally, this means constructing work that allows for the juxtaposition of an
ongoing performance with different activities, dynamically interrupting participants,
and utilizing flexible temporal structures that allow them to engage and disengage with
a given aesthetic experience according to the circumstances of their everyday lives. (93)&quot; - coming back and going to it.Often associated with poetry rather than narrative.
&quot;both ritual and poetry deal with the sacred; both are supposed to lead to an event that deeply transforms the participants; in both cases, finally, the accomplishment of this event depends on the precise observance of formal requirements – gestures in the case of ritual, language in the case of poetry.&quot;
talking about &quot;private rituals&quot; - Anne?
Don't necessarily agree with her that the ifea of ritual must be strictly religious, or that there is no audience/performer division in ritual, 
she thinks rituals re symbolic rather than practical - i think they are practical. THeefore can tie to game actions, actions within a system.
Ryan in ritual - &quot;I find games the most difficult to distinguish from the secular form of rituals&quot;

points out that ritual is sequential
Talks about division of space in ritual.
&quot; they allow communication between humans and the gods and therefore break the boundary between the sacred and the profane&quot;
Her linking of narrative and ritual points to a way to think narratively about ritual - and to see ritual as a way to interact with an environmental character, and make productive comparisons between engagement with place and engagement with person - geographic or topographic or physical acts become social acts.
She says that repetition - but in my game, the repetition and order is brok n - the narrative comes from the slow breakdown of the ritual relationship - the 'cracks' in the ritual, and Anne's persomna in the book. Can be both linear and repetitious - hers are repetitious.

PErformative experience design 
Performance is a sometimes exhilarating, sometimes exhausting experience, made up of but experientially very different from a person’s normal activities
&quot;the conscious display of behaviour that others might observe&quot;
In my work, the performance is more self-oriented.

&quot; performance provides a lens for understanding and designing for the emotionally and aesthetically powerful interactions that involve perceptions of engagement with digital technology&quot; - and vice versa
YOu are more performing for the creature -

&quot; There are at least two ways of reducing the strength of the performance frame and/or the game structure: one is to conduct the experience in private, and the other is to engage users in a private phase of preparing for a later performance&quot;
&quot;. It is also shared by researchers who subscribe to Steve Benford et al.’s notion of ‘ uncomfortable interactions’ , which ‘cause a degree of suffering to the user’&quot;

Performance as a &quot;structured, regulated experience&quot; (like ritual)
Performance studies rather than drama proper.
&quot;monolithic, ethnic-religious caricatures&quot;
Schechner talks about ritual as performance
&quot;Play, games, sports, theatre and rituals have five basic qualities in common: a special ordering of time, a special
value attached to objects, non-productivity in terms of goods, rules, and performance spaces [48].&quot;
Ludus is ritualistic play.
So often talk about religion in games is sociological (what real-world things does it mirror) rather than how, mechanically, religious belief and practice is mirrored in gameplay experience.
&quot;Games may mirror spiritual experience&quot;
Compares dramatic text to the code of the game, performance to the act of runtime, and mise-en-scene (the audience's engagement with performance) as interaction with runtime.Relates it also to the tripartite MDA framework.
Playing the other - a reference for lots of religion in games
Games become a way to suspend religious worldviews and take on other views - the fluidity of religious beliefs, on an autocosmic spectrum between 'real' and 'not real', comp-art as a medium that provokes questioning and adoption of other religious belief structures even if consciously modal.
Some see games' reliious representations as simplistic or othering (references in this article) - Aupers, 2012; Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter, 2009; Kline et al., 2003
&quot; The renewed relevance of religion prompted sociologists (Gorski, 2012), art historians (King, 2005), literary scholars (Mohamed, 2011) and political theorists (McLennan, 2010), among others, to conceptualize the current period as ‘post-secular’ (Habermas, 2006, 2008).&quot; - more about fascination with religion, for these guys, rather than a mixing of science and spirituality. More political, for them (Habermas) than anything else.
‘I sort of believed’
&quot;a strong example of what has been termed digital Games’ ‘reenchantment’, introducing gods and magic – safely, within the boundaries of a culturalproduct – to atheist consumers who actually ‘want to believe’ (Aupers, 2013).&quot;
3.4 - rather than many Games’ ‘surface level religious symbology’ or a reduction of religion ‘as a set of beliefs’.
Instead of a set of rules and practices, the game shows, through personal experiences, both the hopes and the uncertainties of religion.
&quot; This temporary identification has consequences for one’s own worldview: our atheist respondents confess that role-playing encourages, rein orces or strengthens their empathy for the religious Other.&quot;
&quot; a ‘liminal zone’ in which ‘serious’ issues of everyday life, culture and politics are transgressed, reversed and re-negotiated (e.g. Geertz, 1972; Turner, 1982; Van Bohemen et al., 2014)&quot;
Mixed Reality - &quot; its overlap with the areas of immersive, site-specific and multi-media theatre&quot;
In player appendix - meant to be on their own - the crack obscuyring, the circle mitigating, people trying to observe from outside, can hide from the creature, don't let him know you are there. Move him back even further.
&quot;Eliade mentions “privileged places” like the place of birth, and the place of one’s fi rst love, that form “holy places” in one’s “private universe” (1987,
24).&quot;
&quot;Performance is deeply rooted in the tropes and rhythms of everyday life , particularly those genres of performance that eschew
stages and greasepaint in favour of a more immediate connection with audience”
Talks about Laurel trying to create sacred spaces - in her Placeholder project, recreate a sacred space. Am I trying to do this?
&quot;Some uncomfortable interactions even aim for an aesthetic experience that users might experience as enlightening: ‘demanding a
deep personal commitment, reducing the risk of trivialisation, and in turn, promoting empathy and respect’ ( 2012 , p. 2006).&quot;
&quot;concepts of performa tivity and performance in terms of experience as an emergent event whose param eters can be designed for, even if the event itself cannot be directly designed.&quot; - link to emergence.
&quot;The case study presented here complements these works by moving performance from the public realm to the private, personal, and enclosed.&quot; - reference her case study

&quot;PED encourages thinking in terms of
increasing or decreasing both the degree of ‘performance’ and the complexity of the

Greg Perreault - videogames problematise religion, focus on violence and divisive elements.
Links riddles, gods testing us in imaginary realms to games and &quot;systemic challenges&quot; in interactive art.&quot;The power to incant through language has always been a central element of enchantment. Covino (1994) reminds us that the words “spelling” and “grammar” have their origins in sorcery and offer a reflection of the capacity of one skilled with words to cast “spells”.
the exploration of 'outer' rather than 'inner' layers of narrative, the crafting of 'dynamic szuyhets - is this what the ritual is doing? C ontent ourselves with the “outer layer” - rather than “inner layers” of the characters (Ryan) (in conclusion) - lead onto manuals - talking about mystery again.
mixed-reality performances tend to be inherently hybrid in their structure: combining multiple real and virtual worlds in various relationships; incorporating multilayered timescales; establishing various roles such as actors, orchestrators, participants, audiences, and bystanders; and finally, integrating diverse forms of interface into a single experience.
&quot; four definitions of performativity: as a capacity for action (though not always individual agency), as a process of performance, as active engagement (embodied, mental, energetic, and the like), and as an indication of markers of theatricality or a perfor-
mance frame.&quot;
&quot;Design for situatedness refers to paying attention to the physical, temporal, and social aspects of the performance experience .&quot;
&quot;Performability is to ritual what tellability is to narrative.&quot;
The PED approach can be applied to any situation where people interact with digital technology in a 'performative' way - meaning in front of other people, like an audience, or on their own, as if rehearsing how they will present themselves to others.
Animals are seen as a component of environment, alongside human beings - now we have changed that. Anne is completely separate from the creature as environment - what she always wanted - flying above it.

&quot; these are works that explore social, political, and experiential boundaries of digital interfaces.&quot;
&quot;single works that are not necessarily intended for wider commercial use but instead live in the context of the artrelated venues and engage participants in full-body interaction with computational physical interfaces.&quot;
&quot; interactive installations as inspirational artistic probes for human-computer interaction (HCI). &quot;
&quot;Definitions by Suderburg and Rush translate into an emphasis on (1) bodily interaction beyond restricted mouse clicking, (2)
physical interfaces (often on a large scale) involved in digital technologies that can reconfigure a space, and (3)
participants’ engagement. Combining these perspectives, interactive installations can be defined as facilitating the
physical as well as the emotional engagement of the audience, involving bodily interaction in the reconfigured
space of the art-related context. &quot;
&quot;According to Paul, this classic triad of art involvement is blurred as (1) “Rather than being the sole ‘creator’ of a work of art, the artist often plays the role of a mediator or facilitator for audiences’ interaction with and contribution to the artwork,” (2) the “public or audience becomes a participant in the work, reassembling the textual, visual, and aural components of the project,” and (3) “artwork is often transformed into an open structure in process that relies on a constant flux of information and engages the viewer/participant in the way a performance might do” [31]&quot;
Bell's perfomance criteria for &quot;installations can reference their audiences’ social and cultural contexts, foster physical and emotional engagement, and influence critical thinking&quot;
&quot;Participants are continuously encouraged to reflect on their own experience based on their individual social and cultural backgrounds but also to act upon it.&quot;

RITUAL - &quot; the spectator becomes a participant in a liminal activity.&quot; - from Victor Turner (70s)
Richard Schechner - Ritual, Play and Performance
I am closer to Grotowski's definition - a rite of passage for a single person, rather than a performance - though of course in Anne's day, a ritual WAS a performance! It had to be. She would irk at this (the Truth is not performed) but it is true. She has just internalised it.
She talks about the stupid ways people will respond, and managing it - cannot get them to leave. They will always have an audience- try and make sure they leave, if you can.
Moving back and forth between lived, bodily experience of our ritualistic actions, and a semiotic, detached awareness of their meanings. This oscillation takes place in knole. HOWEVER &quot;Ritual action, with its intrinsic, socially construed meanings, may be an
exception because it provides an immediate means of signification during the actual living experience&quot;
&quot;Immersive virtual environments, imbued with meaning, are opportunities for post ritual formulations, created by the shamanistic
efforts of the modern, technologically savvy artist. The VE experience itself must precede and inform any narrative retelling of it.&quot;
&quot;not only movement but stationary contemplation&quot;&quot;To interact is to repeat some behaviors as during rituals.
&quot;Sees it as an &quot;electronic ritual&quot;, similar to the hallucinations/trances (TRANS-e) activated by shamans.
&quot;Interactive Art is related to rituals and requires the repetition of actions through devices that respond in real time, simulating a kind of or ceremony mediated by technology.&quot;

Intro To Book - Videogames As Performances (chapter title)
&quot; A virtual environment must allow us to see as much as possible through the eyes of the original inhabitants. It must also suggest ideas of thematically related events, evidence of social autonomy, notions of territorial possession and shelter, and focal points of artefactual possession. In other words, the virtual environment must provide a perspective of a past culture to a user in a manner similar to that deduced by trained archaeologists and anthropologists from material remains (fossils, pottery shards, ruins, etc).&quot;
&quot;Roles and rituals are essential for creating, situating and maintaining cultural practices.&quot;
often &quot;misleading and impoverished social and cultural worlds&quot; (Chapman 2012, Reparaz 2011)
&quot; the meaning behind worlds, rituals and roles are not fully explored &quot; - in games
&quot;The ritual is typically in a specially designated space, with an introduction ceremony and attendance is not open to all. &quot;
&quot;Rituals are also not typically described in literature on computer games, at least not in a way that parallels discussions in anthropology&quot; - this is starting to change.
3.4 - moderating one’s external behaviour in response or anticipation of the opinions or actions of others while in a computer game is a sign that it is functioning as a social world.&quot;
&quot;Culture can be viewed as a material embodiment of social structure, mediating the relation between the individual and the
community and expressing (as well as protecting) the sacred from the profane.&quot;
&quot;Culture also provides instructions on how habits can become intrinsically meaningful and socially
ordered through the practice of ritual (Dornan 2007).&quot; - the ‘culture’ between them, embedded in this landscape.
&quot;how deeply a cultural force is perceived to imprint or ingrain itself on its surroundings; hermeneutic richness may be the depth of affordance that a virtual environment gives to the interpretation of a natively residing culture in that virtual environment. The ability of an artefact to convey a sense of that creator’s agency&quot;
 hermeneutic richness&quot; - interpretation
&quot;If there is cultural presence we should be able to detect a distinctly situated sense of inhabitation, of social values and
behaviors preserved and transmitted through ritual, artefact and inscription.&quot;
&quot;e. For example, Roskams et al. (2013) describe ritual objects as ‘ceremonial, deliberate, formal, formalised, intentional,
non-utilitarian, odd, peculiar, placed, ritual, selected, special, symbolic, token and unusual (Garrow 2012, 93).’ Scott Kilmer (1977, 45) wrote ‘ritual consists of sacred ceremonies and their routines, with the routines being seen as consecrated acts which
contain great mystical powers.’ He added that rituals contain ‘stylized acts’ which are adhered to rigidly.&quot;
&quot;For both audience and performer there may be specific physiological and postural requirements. Mossier (2012, 58), for example, wrote: ‘Various sensorial techniques are used to commit and stimulate the participants’ body, senses and spirit.’ The head and body are directed; there are conventions on where one can look and for how long. By specific physiological requirements I mean that that body has to be controlled, directed and time-regulated, it typically has to be set in repose or rhythmically controlled.&quot;
&quot;There are demanding levels of attention required from both the spectators and from the performers. The ritual is typically part of a wider system of belief, based on mythic causality (the belief that certain actions trigger certain responses at a scale different to the human one).&quot;
He sees play and ritual as very closely aligned - closer thanm the literature has said. A shibboleth.
&quot; Tilley noted (1999, 29): ‘Rituals not only
say something, they do something.’&quot;
&quot;‘ritual regulates the relationship between people and environment’
(1986, 23) HODDER&quot;
&quot;Rituals may allow us to see through the eyes of the original inhabitants, or at least feel that this place once belonged to someone else. Rituals aid our memory; they commemorate important cyclic observations, changes in season, tides and constellations. They allow us to connect back to nature and to wider family groups for both symbolic and practical reasons. Rituals can also function as a rite of passage or as social control. Most importantly for our purposes, rituals are a way of preserving and passing on cultural knowledge. Yet how does one design for a cultural ritual taking place in a particular cultural place in virtual heritage environments? Digital environments typically lack an in-world social authority or audience to ensure rituals are practiced correctly; participants are not fully physiologically immersed in the digital space; they lack the means to fully teach ritualistic practice; they also lack reasons and incentives to develop and refine rituals through long-term practice.&quot;
Just like the challenges of travel, games coerce players through a punishment and reward system, to act and behave in different ways in order to reach their goal.&quot; - for 3.4, around ritual/coercion of user.
He advocates using advanced sensing to check what player is doing (behind avatar) and use that as social cues for NPCs. An interesting idea (and I am using sensors in knole, obviously) but really that is just about making NPC more complex, more sensors. This is not revolutionary, but it might just be too much work. Too much like telepathy? Ignoring the divide between player and avatar?
He thinks social presence is easier than cultural presence - I disagree.
&quot;arefully crafting the device or system to prompt particular types of performance&quot;
Types of ritual - consecration, apotropaism, purification, respect, gift-giving to place. Everyday things like food preparation, health concerns, navigation, hunting etc. 
The crossing of a real/fictional 'seam' built into the fiction - the creature behind glass.
Huizinga, in his anthropological study of play, brings in this idea of severity, or rather seriousness. He states that the modern belief that play is a frivolous, superfluous activity is misguided and stagnant; that play has always at its heart a meaning, and that meaning is often extremely serious (which is not the same as grave, unhumoured or boring). This meaning has, he admits, been obfuscated by the desacralisation of play as we moved away from primitive religion. 
You are dealing with the aftermath of another narrative - uncovering what happens, but by doing so end up hurting the creature at its centre
Ryan - &quot;The borders themselves are liminal areas and
their crossing, allowed only at certain points, requires the performance
of elaborate rituals&quot; - the differentiation of space - but they don’t, really. You can just touch the creature, naturalistically.
&quot;The creature is a manifestation of her private world.

What does it mean to engage in ritual alone? If, as Janet Murray says, “games are ritual actions allowing us to symbolically enact the patterns that give meaning to our lives,” how do solitary rituals create meaning without the social aspects that so often define our lives (Hamlet on the Holodeck, 1997)? Perhaps these solitary rituals must necessarily be acts of self-reflection or even confrontation. Trekking through Journey alone, I started to explore my own approach to the game and to my sudden sense of loss. More than ever, Journey became a ritual experience.

Outside ritual it reveals itself.
Anne’s rituals are entirely imaginary, processed in her brain – builds a deficient picture of creature in her head and its utility, and its rituals, drawn from her own private religion.
Of course, the visitor's interactions with the masterbeast reveal that it is anything but a mute and unfailing servant, and Anne's narrative ignores its systemically-represented personable, social and emotional traits. 
It wants to get pregnant - she sees it without ‘the instruments of union’.
Playing the System - newman sees our relationship with character not as merely 'identifying' with them, but experiencing them as simulations. That we don't engage with individual chgaracters, but with the game as a system. Perhaps this, then, is the problem of scope summed up. becoming part of the system itself. Make the system the character then!!!

Smith and Worch call them &quot;simulation boundaries&quot; - what the game permits. These are, in a sense, metaleptical - the sense that this sort of game doesn't allow things. But it is dissatisfying. They talk about &quot;disconnects&quot; between the autocosmics and what the game systems actually allow.
&quot;Rituals are also not typically described in literature on computer games,&quot;

Grimoires are books that contain a mix of spells, conjurations, natural secrets and ancient wisdom. Their origins date back to the dawn of writing and their subsequent history is entwined with that of the religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the development of science, the cultural influence of print, and the social impact of European colonialism.&quot;

The system mostly obscures its rules, or only reveals them in obscure ways (or less obscure ways, through an instruction book? Bypasses observation, does the observation of a space for you? My instructions are obscure? Not really telling you how it works, even though that is the point of it all. Using the form of instruction literature, but not really instructional? Instructions are seen as diegetic, but they are also mimetic, showing the system OUTSIDE the system, the system that sustains it, and what is important to that system - authorship etc. A book taht shows us the world has a perspective on that world, which is similar to instruction.)
Historians use cookbooks as primary source documents in much the same way they use any written record of the past.
There are ways the historian can read between the lines of the recipes, so to speak to answer questions that are not directly related to cooking or material culture but may deal with gender roles, issues of class, ethnicity and race. Even topics such as politics, religion and world view are revealed in the commentary found in cookbooks and sometimes embedded in what appears to be a simple recipe. The most valuable of cookbooks and related culinary texts also reveal what we might call complete food ideologies.

Arose out of the periplus and prestipino, guidebooks for pilgrims on their travels to distant holy lands – we then find them resurface in the phenomenon of the Grand Tour across Europe, expanding when the rail networks in the Victorian Age democratised rail travel to a certain extent, and the system of travel became even more – Baedecker guides 
Guidebooks, as well, serve as ways to make sense of place-as-a-system, as an unpredictable thing to navigated, with dangers and opportunities at every turn – just like the magician navigating the spirit world, or the world of natural medicines. Like grimoires, they tell you what to wear, what to pack, what precautionary rituals to undertake be that the vaccine or the exchange of currency. It will tell you the customs and speech of the inhabitants of the worlds you will visit, the weather, – the syntactical similarities with the Grimoire of Honorius, say, are staggering. And, like any good grimoire, they are obsessed with providing you with secrets – the best places to go, where to get the best people, how you, if you follow their instructions, can get the best out of your trip. The obsession with getting to the “backstage” (Goffman 1959), the secrets of a place. 
Don’t just provide us with instructions for doing – instructions for thinking, as well. Follow the instructions in their heads. Cernau - “recipes can refer both to a system of communication and a complex set of literary concepts” - both self-evidentially of artistic or meaningful worth, and of worth to somebody trying to operate outside them. 
Slide – Guidebooks
Obvious place to start is recipe books, even though Anne admits in her grimoire that she hates to cook – common ancestry with grimoire, arising out of the herbals and other ingredients-based spells that stretches back to Saxon England and the phenomenon of Leechcraft, and became a major way for women to be literate and published in ages when most grimoires were written by and for male scholars and magicians. Recipe books have changed and persisted right up until the modern day – in a new ‘craze’ of this sort of literature.
And we see the links with grimoires and instructional literature, if we look. These are books that are made to be used, to help us navigate the complex systems of ingredients, some mysterious, even spooky, the destabilising but exciting effects of heat and time on those ingredients, and the cultural contexts of those. It guides us into a better understanding of the world, the system of food, by providing us with instructions that we can follow outside the book, propped beside our cooker or our fridge. e see the magic in them – diagrams of cuts of beef looking like diagrams of the body in Chinese magical texts, HFW - “cooking is a daily drama” - and rarely has it less been less purely instructional, and more valuable on its own, than these days – they even look like Bibles, taking after Mrs. Beetons, the original - they now function as travel books, literary texts, memoirs, polemics – I’m thinking of the activism in HFW’s recipes, the literary sensuousness of Nigella Lawson, the amazing prose of Nigel Slater (indeed, his book Appetite is really just an extended essay on food, with recipes spread between), the world-ranging of Yotam Ottolenghi, and the medical cross-over with the countless diet books. All of them concerned with navigating systems of function and meaning – concerned with a subset of the world, and how to navigate it and propiate it for your food. Especially in case of diets, a lot of it is superstition, and yet people follow it anyway.
 It could be argued that this leads to a multiplicity of methodologies, each with their own challenges, constraints and criteria for judgement. However, for the purposes of this thesis I do not define the Project as primarily transmedial; I do not see it as a collection of different texts or &quot;versions&quot; (Jenkins), each investigating and representing character separately yet &quot;transfictionally&quot; (Saint-Gelais, 2005). I do not see it as primarily an example of &quot;convergence culture&quot; in which all media are interrelated, interposed and interactive in public networks (Jenkins), nor as part of the &quot;franchise&quot; or &quot;economic convergence&quot; of transmedia work that is driven by &quot;large-scale commercial and market logics&quot; (Freeman).
Of course, not everybody who buys guidebooks visit the plays or undertake the instrumentality, just like not everybody who buys grimoires tries to summon demons or learn the secrets of Heaven with it. The grand tour books were mainly bought by people who never left England, and its no different today. We have the well-worn concept of the “armchair traveller” - sometimes derisive, but points to the power of guidebooks on their own to transport, not only to aid the transported, through their evocation of place.

Slide – Literature As Cookery
Sometimes the crossovers between purely instructional and artistic/narrative have been more explicit. Like Water For Chocolate, The Cuttlefish, Pomegranate Soup, The Debt To Pleasure, Kafka’s Soup by Mark Crick, Heartburn by Nora Ephron – all novels which use recipes as literary devices (even if the readers don’t have to actually make the recipes) – fantasy often provides us with a host of recipes, sometimes even producing paratexts – the lord of the rings cookbook, a feast of ice and fire, narnia cookbook, the Redwall series – the world-building required.

IGra (2015) - Cookbooks are not plots or colorful anecdotes for history: they are history. Just like primary sources in the archive, we have to interpret them, read them in context, and read between the lines to look for motivations and interests. Cookbooks can be ideological, they can make medical arguments, and they can serve as charity projects. Like every piece of history, it’s not only about writing or telling a story, but about developing as a reader, and constantly challenging your sources and your own presumptions.
I have spent some happy, nostalgic afternoons recently re-reading the manuals that came with many of my childhood toys, preserved by enthusiasts in online archives. In review, they are masterpieces of suggestive, empathetic writing; invitations to participate in a completion of a loop, a consensual storytelling between child, artefact and designer. Unlike a videogame, the boundaries of the narrative play that they encourage are rarely set; indeed, it seems that as toys have become more and more computationally dependent on consumer electronics, the prescription by the designer has increased. The simpler the toy, the more expansive, imaginative and rich its use in play. Whether this is a good or a bad thing is irrelevant; it provides lessons for designers designing now.

“ how a manual as paratext acts to support videogames through incorporation of other print media forms such as the comic book or the picturebook, through presenting a model of the ideal gamer, and through presenting the manual itself as an object from within the videogame.

a menu actually is poetry. It's short verse, there's a physical structure to how it looks and it's using words with a multiplicity of meaning a lot of times. I've thought about turning how I think about a recipe like chicken stock into a poem which will tell you how I think about chicken stock. And then you can go take a cookbook recipe — every cookbook has a recipe for chicken stock. But with a poem you walk into a thought process. You know, what am I looking for? What is the value of chicken stock? And so I think to be a good cook above all else you need to be thoughtful, you need to care. And so how do you make a picture of thoughtfulness? [Laughs]
“Attempts to move from human-centredness to more inclusive and empathetic points of view are philosophically and practically fraught, involving the biggest question of all, whether language (and therefore our writing) is complicit in humans' supposed alienation from nature.” - no more than writing alienates us from human relationships. - here we talk about text specifically as a form.

For him, paratext is the ‘larger social context’ of a game as it is present both inside and outside the game. “he videogame manual alters the interpretation of a videogame through a number of different variants (to keep in mind the variantological connection), up to and including the ways different manuals shape initial reception, employ other forms of media insert textual humour, and reinforce the existence of the gameworld.”
“they were created to help players come to terms with this new media form, they changed and evolved to reflect the technological sophistication of the games, and when the games’ sophistication reached a point where they could do anything the manual did, the manual faded away, its task complete. Rendered obsolete, the video game manual is a dead media form.

&quot;designers are becoming more

 In one of the many insights
offered by the inclusion of the practitioner interviews, Matt Adams of Blast Theory
suggests that there is an interesting tension between the human–computer
interaction and the artistic approaches to interfaces, whereby the former aims to
design interfaces that are ‘clean, simple, easy, quick and adaptive to multiple
styles’, whereas an artist sees the potential of using the interface to introduce
‘ambiguity and uncertainty, putting people into a position where the rules are not
necessarily quite as clear’ (146).
Character-as-enviro tends to be emergent, and needs to impose an interpretative strategy onto it to draw out narrative sense and character (I.e. the HK)
Will everyone engage with the HK? Maybe not. Is this a problem?

&quot;With no method

players must mentally store information found, or record notes.&quot;
Escape To Na Pali is a guidebook, in a way. A way to interpret a place - both metaleptically and as an experienced place. But also a literal guide, a retelling of the way through the game.
The Housekeeping and creature - Mary Fuller and Henry Jenkins (1994) have explored the link between mapping and mastery with attention to the so- called New World travel writing produced by colonists and Nintendo games, respectively. Fuller associates mas-

&quot;Wolf shows how each of these three elements are realised in worldbuilding through para-textual elements which exist outside of the narrative
(usually found, as Ursula K. Le Guin characterised them in her world-building
work Always Coming Home as “the back of the book”). For the space in which
things exist there are maps of the world. For the duration or space of time in a
world there are descriptive timelines and chronologies. For characters there
are genealogies which give a given character a rootedness; a history and
pedigree. All three key world-building para-texts have become the staple of
many imaginary worlds, including of course Tolkien’s&quot;
a nineteenth-century gazetteer - &quot;the relic of a time when travelling in the real world was still exciting and adventurous.&quot;

 It is also not always clear where the offline and online sections of a game begin and end, nor would I try to make the point that a game must be relentlessly, unendingly systemic. 
 Daniel Dunne has expanded Genette’s concept of ‘paratext’ specifcally for videogames, muddying the divide considerably between what is part of the artwork, the ‘text’, and what is not. Manuals often share the amphibian nature of grimoires – both commenting upon the game system, and being part of its narrative meaning.

Rules for interacting with it.
The model of a manual being the control scheme/story means that the reader of the manual is not confounded with the protagonist; the game, in essence, is separate from the story. The interaction is separated from the story, the protagonist being a guide to your own interactions. The creature and the book are your links back to the real ‘story’, which is the story of Anne. Though your story with the creature, and how you treat it, and how that relates to Anne’s treatment of it, is also important.
Guidebooks are static - a narrative up until now.
Like a book, the creature needs a ‘recto’ and ‘verso’ - a “comparative visual space” (edX). Thus, a mirror of itself? Isn’t the ‘holy manual’ its ‘verso’? 
A guidebook tells you what to do, but also provides you with ways NOT to do things.

But the dusty relic that is a game manual was an important part of the gaming experience for nearly a decade, and it is a shame to see it fall into obscurity.
One of gaming’s most infamous instruction manuals, the booklet for StarTropics (1990), an action-adventure game for the NES, features one of the most engaging and striking uses of meta in a video game (meta refers to something outside of the actual game). Attached to the game’s manual was a yellowed piece of paper, supposedly resembling parchment, that held a secret code within its fibers that could only be seen when some water was rubbed over the paper. During the quest, protagonist Mike Jones is told to “dip [the] letter in water,” and players are tasked with figuring out what this means.
The act of playing through the game and figuring out the mystery is quite the experience, and nothing quite like it has ever been done since. Since most players bought the game used, without a manual, the code was constantly published in Nintendo Power, but for those that solved the puzzle firsthand, it remains a great moment in gaming. The Virtual Console release of the game includes the letter in with the digital manual, and at the bottom of the screen is a small pail of water, which is Nintendo’s way of trying to be true to the material.
Super Mario Bros.
There’s a bit of a dark past hidden in Super Mario Bros.’ booklet. The story, as described in the manual’s first few pages, involves the Koopa tribe turning the Mushroom Kingdom’s residents into bricks, stones, and “field horsehair plants” (commonly considered the game’s Fire Flower power-up). This would mean that Mario is actually shattering bricks with human souls when he grabs coins and ingesting people to throw fireballs. The sordid implications were eventually ret-conned, but the original manual stands as a sort of morbid tome to the Mushroom Kingdom’s sordid past.
Instructional Poetry (Neil Gaiman)
Ever want to jump into your favorite story or fairy tale? Famed fantasy writer Neil Gaiman gives us some guidelines. The world of the imagination is indeed exciting, exhilarating, and even somewhat scary. But as great stories teach us, it is always worth the journey. Go ahead. You'll be fine.
Very tempting - these secrets are either concerning things divine, natural or humane. But thou mayst
examine a few, and the most select, which thou wilt commend with many more.
Grand Grimoire - dated 1500s but probably 19th century
Cunning men “used manuals of fortune-telling and/or astrology, and handwritten collections of herbal recipes and magical formulae.”
So functional - much more mysterious for those who have only heard of them…“Strange words” or “strange symbols” feature a lot in testimonies - hints of books, fleeting glimpses, like rare animals. Lack of understanding sends autocosms wild. 
‘Spatial involvement’ with creature.
Maps “hold the magic of anticipation without the toil and sweat of realistation” (Forbes in Macfarlane) - characters in novels are much the same? Novels are much the same? Same in games? A map to a character - the novel itself, manual etc.
Difference between diegesis and non-diegesis in systematising. Diegetic and non-diegetic for paratexts in #3.
Ryan’s ‘textualisation’ (just described) versus ‘narrativisation’ (narrative) of space. In manuals etc?
Grand Grimoire even tells you what Lucifer will say. Lays out exactly how things will go. It is a story, which you are expected to believe will happen. In a way, it doesn’t matter if people actually perform the ritual or not…
Very hyperbolic language - provoke imagination./
“Articles” of the covenant between them.
It describes what will happen when you go to get treasure (see a big dog) - autocosmics.
The housekeeping is also a guide to Nighthead - “in our village”
Subtle, themic decoration around page borders of non-story pages.
Difference between game manuals and car manuals, for example, is that the former is voluntary - simulated problems, but talked about as if they couldn’t be overcome with extra coding - they are part of the magic circle already. The others are for real problems - still voluntary, but hard limits of machine, not the artificial limits of the program.
duncan speakmans work as a piece that uses books. Borsuk and bouse (2016) as well.
Pictures of what angels would look like -&gt; “to heighten the anticipation of the reader”
The autocosmic wedded to the instructional,a nd the narrative power of performance.
“The Grand Pentacle or Circle of Solomon will answer for the above and following Conjurations, which can be said on all days and at all hours. If it be desired to speak only with one spirit, one only need be named, at the choice of the reader.” -&gt; very precise instructions (from Honorius)
Grimoires - (Sort Of) Like The Housekeeping!
Like cunning folk, courting autocosmics. 
Arbatel of magick has “unintelligble greek” near the start - drawing you in…
Carlos Gilly - ‘The First Book of White Magic and personal communication. The later parts of the Arbatel were announced several times, but never have been written. Don’t know who the author was. The Volschov catalogue listed many fictitious works.	
Make them objects of temptation.
&quot;miscellany&quot; containing &quot;magical recipes, mostly for healing&quot; - Cadwaladr Davies' book
&quot;theological overkill&quot; in whom they are calling up.
Grimoires often tell you to be alone.
Black &amp; White Manual - “people who need a god always get one”.
“Learn the following controls to help you rule your worlds.”
“Here are some hints and information on how to be an efficient and effective god.”
Videogame manuals often describe the history, the past, what has happened up until that point, dropping you in media res. It delineates the space that you will be occupying by giving it context. In the original Prince of Persia, you have been imprisoned by Jaffar, therefore your escape has meaning; not just to save the princess, but to save the princess in time.
Flying Corp - representing everything possible. The planes are the characters, and manipulation of them crosses the social/spatial/systemic manipulation divide. Especially because they are so complex.
Nothing much in storyworld apart from him. 
From Leechcraft - Griffiths suggests that the repetition and alliteration evident in charms may not only have aided memory but also have an emphatic quality ‘indicating the assumed power of statement over event’ 19 
Honorisu - lots of latin and hebrew names, obscure bible references. Requires length planning, expensive ingreedients - meant to be exclusive, makes it seem more impressive, deters sceptics because of the high cost of testing theories. A guidebook to mediating relationships, a precise and localised landscape - the summoning circles etc. It will tell you what to pack, what to wear, the customs of the inhabitants etc. Very funcitonal ,tells you precisely what to do; transcends its own mysticism What vaccinations you need, currency, the costs of things.
“A book of guidance with proofs of guidance distinguishing right from wrong”
Trying to impart knowledge - not to do what seems obvious, or what you might do without teaching - how to intepret a system, how to use it pleasingly.
Requires patience, time and application.
Converting and mixing the natural world in unusual ways.
Origin of recipe books was often magical or herbal remedies. (c.f. Merryell Williams book of recipes)
So recipe books have a link to the era as they were a legitimate method of record for literate women.
Recipe books are about using the system of the world.
“cookbooks are like novels”
 Like a short story, a good recipe can put us in a delightful trance. “
“Stories of pretend meals” - we run through the recipe in our heads.
Are the recipes in the Housekeeping meant to be performed?
“ the imaginary version tastes incredible.”
“Recipes have a story arc”
Anne’s recipes tell you what she thought, why she did it.
“part of the pleasure of recipe-reading is the feeling that you are about to discover a great secret.
But the recipe also reveals the narratives in the ingredients.
“instructions for servants” in the past.
Raw ingredients, changed by alchemy into something emergently new.
A system of transformation, and a system of raw ingredients.
Even more mathematical, scientific, indeed *magical* now, because of the precise numbers of things.
Can be very simple instructions.
Transformation in every sense: smell, appearance, taste. Sometimes the original ingredients are visible, sometimes not.
Can range from simple lists of instructions to something more...
It is a contingent literature - referencing something else, but having value of its own.
HFW's books are political amanifestoes, implemented through instruction - &quot;My Meat Manifesto&quot;
&quot;Cooking is a daily drama&quot;
his job as a &quot;cookery writer&quot; - not a cook- &quot;is to make sure that every episode has a happy ending&quot;.
The way to do things just right - similarity between manifesto and recipe book.
The system on display here is the meat industry, as well as your store cupboard.
Nigel Slater is a manifesto as well - the recipes are buried within prose, like Hugh's (in Slater's case, it is about food being unpretentious).
It even looks like a Bible.
Diagrams of cuts of beef looking like diagrams of the body in chinese magical texts and european ones - the body as system, to be propiated and treated well.
The face is the “Ontologically richest space” (Sagazan)
His task is to demystify, though! Which in a way the grimoires were, as well.
Navigating the occult world of offal.
The roast is a multi-page affair with tables, preparations the night before etc. Lots of similarities to the grimoire.
Not just instructions, but tips for technique as you go through.
Referring to other recipes elsewhere.
English squeamishness that we are always being told about = superstition?
Tied to the land, and often to folklore.
Special glyphs for vegans
People often make notes, add to their own - link to silva rerum, family cookbooks, the cookbooks of local women, tied into spellbooks.
Foods having characters as well.
Veg Book - &quot;something magical happens when you bake potatoes&quot; - a process of rarefication.
The Pantry/'Store Cupboard Staples' section - an alchemists cupboard. The tools of combination
How do different recipe books arrange themselves? By season, by course, by ingredient, by region etc...
They have become more characterful, more narrative, more descriptive as time has gone on. Fulfilled a role which they did not need to before.
Keep talking and nobody explodes - using a paratext as an integral part of gameplay, as part of game world as well. Little commentaries by a character. Ritualistic. The rules of the small environment. Each disarmamaent is a separate puzzle.
&quot;The heavy-handed exposition that opens many games serves a useful function in orienting spectators to the core premises&quot; - like an instruction book?
The paper world map is better than in-game for him.#
Nigel Slater's descriptions of food (squid description - monks in the rain, was it?P
Number paragraphs, like psalms - meant to be used out of linear context.
Jamie Oliver - &quot;the idea for this book came from a really personal and curious place&quot;
Local produce = return to natural ingredients, environment as a system to explore through the devotive magic of cooking.
Bits of context and history about the dishes are now de rigeur - Waldorf Salad 
The narrative that encapsulates the food is so important. 
Describing what you will see - reading the recipe is doing it in advance. 
Passed down through families...
Ask Owen Davies if he has found any link between cookbooks and grimoires.
Food often known as medicine - jewish penicillin, soup - close too the potion?
Interested in the stories BEHIND food.
TheM HK is a landscape, a body of information too.
Add in enough doubt and circumstance that you will blame yourself if something goes wrong.
Champion - &quot;why should a world, especially a past world revisited to explain past cultural significance, revolve around a current-world player?&quot; Quoting &quot;Matthew Tyler-Jones&quot; - &quot;the virtual world's entire causal mechanics rotate around the player&quot; - 


Bottom line: HOW DOES THIS HELP RESONANCE THROUGH COMPUTATION?

            <Title>Part 1 - Introduction</Title>
            <Text>OVERVIEW

Reintroduce the idea of media-specific resonance of computational characters perhaps being achieved by a balance of imaginative engagement with meaningful systems - and the autocosmic being a good model for that, away from models in other art; as it gives us access to those imaginative relationship between people and experiences/beings/narratives that lie outside the strictly aesthetic. A new angle.

This is a general methodology: a general philosophy to approach the creation of characters, rather than a particular technical approach. A perspective on construction and reception of characters. Not new specific techniques, but new general spirit in which to pursue those techniques. And the autocosmic realm is, obviously enormous, and I tried to draw widely not just on autocosmic elements directly, but on other artistic and technical projects that were clearly inspired by non-artistic imaginative engagement by audiences - in how they tried to both engage their audiences and in how they built their computational systems, the two simulatory systems. This interdisciplinarity is a given. 
EXAMPLES (INCLUDE HOW THEY RELATE BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND IMAGINATION): 
My relationship with my pets and other animals (who else talks about this), I studied my pets for behaviour/ charactefulness, but also how I responded to my pets and other animals, how I performed with them, the narratives and personalities that I ascribed them, distance between real cat and mind-cat, put this into knole dynamic (the cat we kept), familiars as pets:  Systemics vs imagination. How animals become characters. We are building them, but there is something already there.
“sociable robots”, drawing on both narrative theory and psychology (Brazeal, Paro, Geri-Joy, Robin The Robot), trying to provoke the same feelings of intimacy, familiarity and reactiveness through knole, for narrative affect rather than merely utilitarian affect; Systemics vs imagination.
Research into ‘relational artefact’ (Turkle) for the power of the human imagination to enliven simple and meaningful objects and create narrative relationships with them, especially toys (furbys and tamagotchis were big inspirations for the interaction model for knole). (took apart Furbys and Tamagotchis), toys in general  (Woodyer, Piaget, Turke, Mishra, Weizenbaum) - furby stuff builds on piaget stuff. Child psychology, attributing aliveness.  Systemics vs imagination. Toys as ‘empathy machines’, as I called them. How they become more systemic, not just in the imagination. he introduction of microelectronics has led to toys whose personalities and responses are not only imagined by the child, but are real and hard-coded. Away from marketing/commerce. “Love and guilt”, as I called it. Also tied to gamification of relationship. I try to subvert that. How things become characters. How government policy was changed because the narrative suggestion of the toy suggested features it did not have. Turkle’s idea that it is not movement but psychology that now excites us in toys. For adults as well.
Imaginary friends (sherman, elshirst, gjersoe, taylor, hoff, klausen and passman) and how they persist into adulthood, characters which we imaginatively interact with OUTSIDE the narrative/fictional, which we experience within real life, the emotions they provoke, the roles they play.  Systemics vs imagination.
Dehumanisation and compassion fatigue (haque, koltoff ray and anderson) to play with how the human mind can characterise and decharacterise through contact and instrumentalisation, and to play with your emotions for the creature as it gets sicker.  Systemics vs imagination. The creature being seen as more mechanical. How people lose their characterability.
Robots more generally, outside the artistic (McCarthy, Riek et al 2009, Sung, Gaver, The Stem, Novikova and Watts, Novikova, Gaudl and Bryson, Ian Brown, Fink et al 2012, Novkiova 2014, Prendinger and Ishikuza 2005, Delft Study on Roomba Personality, Forlizzi &amp; DiSalvo, Wiseman, Braitenberg, Riskin, Turing, DeAngelis, various Brysons, McCorduck, Connell,) and within (Mateas, Penny, Angliss). Encountered in everyday life, workplace (the hide and research for that), beings that we are interacting with more and more, which we have social relationships with, imaginary relationships with. Relationship between humans and robotos, what we imagination them to be.  Systemics vs imagination.
Can also see the breadth of the study from the rest of this thesis (cognitive psychology, neurology, anthropomorphisation, AI, robotics, etc.) and this chapter.  Systemics vs imagination.
While most of these are outside the bounds of this thesis, and were only introductions to change my thought on the subject of creating characters, they formed a constitutive part of the work of developing this story (see in my wider Zotero bibliography). However, I want to focus for the rest of thesis on one particular example that was central to my work, especially its fiction but also its construction; and which broadly illustrates the utility of taking a autocosmic approach to taking character. Creating resonance by lateral thinking. A general methodology applied specifically. 

This example is how one particular autocosmic relationship - with environment, and landscape - can inform character design in computational art.

            <Text>Section 3.2: Humanity's Complex &amp; Autocosmic Relationship With Space, Place And Environment

FIRST PARA: A reference to Anne’s world, the environment she lives in, her dislike of the moor, the particulars of people’s movements - space and place a big part of this. Anne living at a time when the changing relationship between person and place was particularly heightened. Particularly its relationship to our imagination. Bothy project residency stanage edge visit. @ start - Anne lying at a crossroads. The view on the moor - nature as dangerous, as possessed of intent. Unpredictable. All around react to it in different ways. People’s idea of the moor but few people go out there anymore. The pixies she lists. The cunning fol;k she lists.  Draw it back to the moor.

Overview Of Fields

knole development (drawing on autocosmic philosophy) framed by many different fields, disciplines etc. talking about place and space, across arts, history, science, anthropology etc - united by how space interacts with our autocosmic imagination. The environments in which we exist, and with which we are in 'continual interaction', are of significance both consciously and unconsciously, evolutionarily and culturally, aesthetically and non-aesthetically; it is a dialogue which epitomises the multifarious interpenetration of the autocosmic. It might even be argued that, in the history of our species, that it is the relationship which laid the foundations for all which were to follow. Use these not just to point out the depth of autocosmic relationship with place - as much as with other people - but to provide inspiration for practice. Narrative relationship with place. To show the autocosmic, narrative potential of our relationship with landscape, transcending distinctions of art and life. Becoming a model for building my work - a model for interaction with the story/artwork. Again, only a brief overview of some of the exciting ideas from other fields that are influencing thinking. 
Fields: Literary Theory, Possible World Theory, Ecocriticism, Anthropology, Narratology, Cognitive Science (need a reference for each of these), philosophy, evolutionary science, neuroscience, biology, biosemiotics, “The environmental humanities are the traditional humanities – such as philosophy, literature, religion, art, music, history, language studies, cultural geography – conjoined in new interdisciplinary formations (inc with the natural and social sciences*) to address the environmental crisis currently engulfing us – its antecedents, current forms and future trajectories and possible responses to it.”, ecofeminism, neophenomenology, human geography, heritage interpretation, geocriticism, econarratology, speculative realist philsophy. Not trying to present a universal structures, but pick out similarities.‘Spatial frames’ - what we actually see of the environment. Implies the “setting” (the wider environ) and by extension the “storyworld” (a coherent, unified, ontologically full and materially existing geographical entity, even when it is a fictional world that possesses none of these properties) . The narrative includes both ‘spatial frames’ and mentioned elements from setting - the storyworld comes from autocosmicsSite-specificity. Controls ‘situation factor - Literary geography (neal alexander) - One of the important fields that traces human imaginative engagement with space.&quot;the relationship between humans and the non-human environment&quot; &quot;imaginative geography, literary cartography, geocriticism, geopoetics, geohumanities&quot; ANT - &quot;a space where things take place&quot;. Cybernetics as a field that is interested in this - “exploring regulatory systems”. cultural geography is part of spatial studies as well. Platial studies. vital materialism as an idea. Jane Bennett as an advocate that inanimate objects can have 'viotalioty' - can have tendencies, trajectories, impediments and blocakeg Alfred Gell's 'secondary agents' - the agency tht things possess when they become enmeshed in social relationshiops&quot; - or is it self-suffieicnet? Acts upon people 2010, 1. - The Inka loved rocks. Animate. Made offerings to mountains.- &quot;Fetishism as imbuing objects with power - not the thing itself, what it manifests. The landscape, though, has actual power. But the creature cannot really act upon you? ANT is about connection, communication, rather than something pre-existing. Am I anthropomorphising these ideas of 'actors' and 'agents' too much? Not like human agency? But we DO humanise them. &quot; ecology is less a monolithic or universally agreed upon entity than it is a constantly shifting set of actors, practices, technologies, discourses, and artifacts &quot; &quot;environmental aesthetics has undergone a recent resurgence after being almost entirely subsumed by the nineteenth- and twentieth-century trend toward seeing art objects as the only proper recipients of aesthetic interest.&quot; - an example of nature as aesthetic, our relationship with it as aesthetic. Autocosmic. Berleants work is environmental aesthetics.Heylighen (cybernetics) cybernetics = &quot;abstract principles of organization in complex systems&quot;. so second-order cybernetics is a bit like the reader-response theory of cybernetics - how an observer of a system understands and constructs models of it. This particularly for autocomics. &quot;General Systems Theory (GST), founded at about the same time by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, as an attempt to build a unified science by uncovering the common principles that govern open, evolving systems&quot;. Sharov's paper brings biosemiotics and cybernetics together. Emergence and actor-network theory is a part of this. And systems biolody. and autopoeisis. Strongly related to systems theory. Up to geocybernetics.architecture (with reference to Alexander) &quot; the essence of interactions between humans and the environment in patterns and how they evolve into distinct places.&quot;


Brief History Of Growing Importance: Has changed across time. While &quot;space, which is much easier to conceive than time, has been largely neglected&quot; now we have Fredric Jameson (1991) - the 'spatial turn' - Ryan calls it 'spatiotemporal' - paralleled by interest in what Margaret wilson talking about “situated cognition” (2002) - . “The environment is part of the cognitive system”, grounded cognition (Barsalou) and embodied cognition - “The importance of space has been reasserted in recent years.” - Setting used to be seen as an “empty container” - “Spatial literary studies” - “Bridging the divide between the word and the world” - Ryan's edited book on 'narrating space'. &quot; space is not simply setting; it produces symbolic and emotional meaning, organizes plots, directs patterns of reader engagement, and orients readers effectively to both the spaces within stories and those weencounter and inhabit.&quot; - &quot;we cannot think effectivelyabout narrativewithout thinking about space.” - &quot;a site of negotiation of the lived, experiential qualities conveyed by a story.&quot; - From 'container conception' (Caraciolo) - the connection between place and meaning‑making has been foundational for human geography since the 1970s, and in particular since Yu‑Fu Tuan’s Space and Place.&quot; - &quot;through embodied, emotional, and intersubjective engagements guided by socio‑ cultural practices&quot; - Withers - spatial turn - “place as social practice” - &quot;The spatial is connected to and debated in literally every possible arena of human thinking.&quot; - Simon Schama talks about how identity, myth, memory and emotions are intimately connected to place. Embodied with ideals. Owain Jones - &quot;life is inherently spatial, and inherently emotional&quot; - we use memory, and meotion, and space to orient ourselves in our lives. Make sure I relate it to 1.4. Alexander References Foucault's proclamation that the spatial was more important than the temporal in the modern age (1967). Make it clear that all these fields are coming into the same Venn from different directions.  Actor network theory - Landscape = &quot;where we do everything - Phenom of landscape - LS = &quot;a long-lived dynamic entity deserving explanation&quot; - &quot;The idea of landscape as a set of relational places linked by pathways, movements and narratives&quot;. “landscape is fundamental to human existence because it provides both a medium for, and an outcome of, individual and social practices” - landscapes, in abstract, are formed of places and the paths between them.geocriticism, westphal - space has become really important - 19th century was dominated by &quot;the discourse of time... and teleological development&quot; - Talks about the 'spatial turn' - &quot;geocriticism attempts to understand the real and fictional spaces that we inhabit...&quot; the postmodern or 'post-postmodern condition&quot; - Post-positivist, away from empirical, rational approach - space is not &quot;the empty container&quot; autocosmic is part of this, as well! Westphal, in his introduction, gives an overview of how space has always been symbolic.- &quot;the fruits of a symbolic system, of a speculative movement&quot;. Champion - “&quot;To view a place as a container of x y and z dimensions is to deny it a cultural content. A place is more like a nexus, or a web. &quot;  
Haraway (2016) moves people off-centre as just one agent in landscape.
Reinhard talks about landscape phenomenology - an autocosmic (in part) relationship. Ingold, Heidegger, Merleay-Ponty, Husserl, Tilley
&quot;Territory is place-making, we try to find the optimal site for all conflicting
and varying possibilities.&quot; (difference between space and place.

Pre-Art/Evolution
Drawing on what talked about in chapter 1 - a being in an environment, interested in environment and all its components, the “evolution of human cognition” (Morris-Kay), and as beings with 'bodies located in space'(Wilson 2002) - “The development of an individual from embryo to adult involves a continual interaction between the animal’s genetic makeup and its environment” - “True to phenomenologist doctrine, these authors believe that the most fundamental human experience consists of apprehending oneself as a body located in space.” Dennett’s physical stance. Focussed on what is important to us. Looking for significance that relates to those desires. Ryan defines four features of worlds: “connected set of objects and individuals; habitable environment; reasonably intelligible totality for external observers; field of activity for its members” (Ryan, 2001, p. 91).
Crucially a systemic interest, systemic narratives about place, “relational epistemologies” (Bird-David) - understanding it as a system, “their study of how things-in-situations relate to the actor-perceiver and, from the actor-perceiver’s point of view, to each other”, which is part of practical knowledge (refer back to Sugiyama etc. in Chapter 1). Responding to a complex system all around us that is necessary to our survival. Dennett’s ‘design stance’. &quot;cybernetic/systemic ecology&quot;. Narratives, lines of understanding, causations, systemic narratives, mental models. Yi Fu Tuan takes reader-response approach to our experience of place. Drawing on Paul Shepherd - &quot;only a person who could “establish lines of connectedness or relationship” (think and act according to totemic and animistic concepts) with the natural world could survive.&quot; Sagan - “the myths and folklore of many premodern cultures has explanatory or at least mnemonic value. In stories that everyone can appreciate or even witness, they encode the environment.” Landscape was not dead - it DID react back. Difference between “operational environment” (real world) and “cognised encironment” (how human beings experience that world) (Rapaport). Using our ‘umwelts’, interpreting our ‘semiotic niche’. This supported in modern day by biosemiotics (Kull et al, Sebeok) - how signs and meaning are passed around ecologies, the creation and manipulation of meaningful signs how things appear to each other, on lots of different levels. Meaning attribution ‘stabilises’ processes and allow us to build on them and work with them. “The interpretive capacity is an emergent property of a reciprocal end-means relationship of a self-propagating dynamical system.” Also actor-network theory. Other cybernetic theories of biology. Meaning exterior (what signs are projected) and meaning interior (how signs are interpreted). “The unknown is so inflammatory to the imagination because it is an imaginative malleable space: a projection-screen on to which a culture or an individual can throw their fears and aspirations.” Ambiguity in nature. Rappaport - &quot;on populations in the ecological sense, that is, as one of the components of a system of trophic exchanges taking place within a bounded area.&quot; (Biersack,1999,5) The cognized model according to Rappaport is the &quot;model of the environment conceived by the people who act in it,&quot; (Wolf,1999, 19). “a predictive strategy of interpretation “ - Koenig's imaginative systems - parsing systems and then having a strategy - the 'operational environment'	 Rappaport in which we exist and act as organisms becomes part of the 'cognised environment'. Not just for humans. 'in trophic exhanges' Biersack of varying significances to that particular animal's 'significant surround'. a constant 'interpretative challenge' by all elements of that environment to 'establish lines of connectedness' (Paul Shepherd) ‘Predictive strategy’ (Koenig). actor-network theory - social and natural worlds are relationship systems between actors in networks. all about process and dynamic between factors. Bruno Latour 2005 a reference - A post-structuralist approach - the 'actor-network' - related to Guattari's rhizomes - Emergence in a system from components - punctualisation - all actors are made up of smaller actors. Become 'tokens' or 'quasi-objects'. &quot;Stories tell about the actions of intelligent agents. These agents are situated within a world, and so are the objects they act upon. One may infer from this description that telling a story necessitates, in the words of David Herman “modeling, and enabling others to model, an emergent constellation of spatially related entities.”&quot; - Remember distinctions between geographic space and symbolic space - still are inherently relational in nature. We enjoyed 'pattern-making' - The cognitive activity underlying pattern-making is complex, involving planning and intention, but the original idea of pattern may be a function of the brain - &quot;Roger M. Downs and David Stea argue that “cognitive mapping is a process composed of a series of psychological transformations by which an individual acquires stores, recalls, and decodes information about the relative locations and attributes of the phenomena in his everyday spatial environment” (qtd. in Kitchin and Freundschuh 2000, 1)&quot;. they are &quot;labs&quot; for turning hypothetical experience into real experience. &quot;complex new model&quot; of categorisation in early humans of their environment. (Talking about Levi-Strauss' work) - important signs were made into symbols. a &quot;dynamic map... coming into being&quot; storytelling both helps remember this map and activates its symbols, folding them into everyday behaviours.
moving from space -&gt; place. “space only becomes place when people are able to imbue it with meaning”. Focussed on 'situatedness' - about place. “material stuff gathered at this spot” and “narrations, interpretations and imaginations that gie the place distinctive meaning and value”. Specific places, not just ‘space’ generally. A particular ‘umwelt’. Not “universalizing one’s own perspective. &quot; (cognitive science in ecocrit) - “ by which we understand the properties of complex objects in relation to one another.” Drawing on Tuan a place is a stable object in space that catches our attention. - &quot;As we experience space, and construct representations of it, we know that it will be continuous. Everything is somewhere, and no matter what other characteristics object do not share, they always share relative location, that is, spatiality; hence the desirability of equating knowledge with space, an intellectual space. This assures an organization and a basis for predictability, which are shared by absolutely everyone. This proposition appears to be so fundamental that apparently it is simply adopted a priori. A. H. Robinson &amp; B. B. Petchenik, The nature of maps: essays towards understanding maps and mapping, 1976, p.4&quot;. “Space becomes place as it acquires experiential depth&quot; Foote and Azaryah. From space -&gt; environment - Ryan's book - (from review) &quot;a network of relations between objects&quot; one might encounter there (45)&quot;. Ecology - &quot;the principles... that make relations with an environment systemic&quot; - “Innate awareness that there is more to the ordering of fate than appears on the surface” (superstition) - He quotes Norberg Schulz on the importance of place to mankind. Place is resonant space. Place As Historically-Contingent Process - place as a &quot;constantly becoming human product as well as a set of features visible upon the landscape&quot;. &quot;place as a process&quot; - it is constantly going on. People are &quot;process participants... integrated human beings&quot; - &quot;institutional and individual practices&quot; - &quot;the ever-becoming place.&quot; &quot; a process whereby an endless dialectic between practice and social structure expresses itself locally.&quot; &quot;It is a process whereby the reproduction of social and cultural forms, the formation of biographies, and the transformation of nature ceaselessly become one another&quot; place-making - &quot;organise space in such a way as to mark the topos as special, to set it apart from the spaces surrounding and infusing it&quot; Champion - &quot;Place gains unique character through time and use&quot; Place is mark-able, recordable, it leaves signs of its use, it erodes or denudes into more or less usability.&quot; Place is particular, unique, dynamic, and memorably related to other places, peoples, and mto events (tasks and happenings). place = &quot;a region recognisable to a user as a
culturally coded setting&quot;
Particularly seen in correspondence with Dennett’s intentional stance - place not only seen as a systemic relation, but as a social other. &quot;the employment of human socially biased cognitive skills&quot; (Bird-David). Anthropomorphism/animism - towards environments as a whole and as animals. Animals as componetns of, representatives of and commeasurate with the landscape. Positions on this range from cognitivist to procedural (Ingold). &quot;relational personhood&quot; - things can become persons through our interaction with them. Attributing belief, goals, inner experience, thoughts and emotions (Robbin and Jack, 2006). Use to “predict” behaviour (dictionary of philosophy of mind). Intentional stance as _subset_ of design stance. &quot;efficient&quot; even if wrong. Turned out Nice Again (2013) - the weather as a &quot;creature of our imagination&quot;. a way to understand the systems in the world around us that we did not have the ‘science’ for, espcially complex systems. &quot;attempt to explain patterns... hit upon animism as a good - actually, predictive - approximation of some unimaginably complex phenom&quot;. old animism - &quot;myth-making practices that imbue the environment with unbounded nonhuman vitality&quot;. “a functional method of understanding otherness (Doniger 33-34).” Dennett’s work: from a &quot;hyperactive agency detection device&quot; (Barrett, 2004) arising from evolutionary pressures. Building on Boyer (2001) and Shermer (1997). Dennett states that we are instinctively drawn, both in our senses, subdoxastic responses (Gao &amp; Scholl 2011, Gao Newman and Scholl 2009, LeDoux 2004, Barrett et al 2005, Takahasi and Watanabe, 2013)) and our imaginative extrapolation, to anything which reveals agency in the world around us. This became the major way that we understood the world around us. Such elements in our environments, more than any other, could spell trouble or opportunity to the subject's survival prospects (Lofstedt 1996, Subbotsky 2014).in a classic act of evolutionary over-engineering (Scheele et al, 2015). fraught, &quot;quick and dirty&quot; (Tavinor, 2007) “heuristic sensitivity” (Blom, 2010) was very tolerant of &quot;false positives&quot; (Fodor, 1983) in the agency-detection process (Guthrie, 1993), leading to a suite of well-documented phenomena such as pareidolia (Blom, 2010), animism (Heider &amp; Simmel, 1944) and anthropomorphism (Guthrie, 1993). Levi-Strauss “totemism” - animals as other ‘persons’, as beings, as characters. “non-human entities possess a spiritual essence” (animism), “ancient man experienced his environment as consisting of definite characters” - at different scales. “Inhumanity” but not characterlessness. (Macfarlane). from subdoxastic responses	 Gao and Scholl 2011 Gao, Newman and Scholl 2011LeDoux 2004 to conscious imaginative engagement - Heider and Simmel, 1944 - Ingold (”functional”) - All semiotic processes at human scale are about communication of symbols within minds, “the biological processes constituting minds” - “At the root of human belief in gods lies an instinct on a hair trigger: the disposition to attribute agency—beliefs and desires and other mental states—to anything complicated that moves. &quot; - the etiology, structure, and attributes of logos (transcendent or higher truths) that bind human beings into meaningful and enduring social orders and enable the trustworthy communication necessary for a shared social and cultural life.” The way holiness, sacredness, functions as part of an environment, and a system. A 'regulatory hierarchy'. &quot;cybernetics of the holy&quot; - &quot;&quot;by the excess population of imaginary agents&quot; - The whole environment is 'punctualised', to differing degrees, becoming 'quasi-objects' for the superstitious. FWB is &quot;innate to human culture&quot; - &quot; the tendency of the person network to be triggered by certain stimulus features even when we are aware that the stimulus is not a person&quot; - patterns of motion, facial recognition - &quot;in sum, we come into the world with a brain system genetically preprogrammed to represent persons as distinct from other kinds of objects in the world. This system is surprisingly autonomous, in the sense that it is triggered by
certain stimuli and can be difficult to suppress. It becomes active even when we know that the triggering stimulus is not a person, that is, when other parts of our brain representtheinformationthatthestimulusisnotaperson,butan
unrealistic drawing of a person or even a geometric shape. Indeed, it becomes active in the presence of triggering stimulus features even when irrelevant or downright counterproductive.
A &quot;person network&quot; - 'person' is not a real thing in the world, like 'plants' - 'plants' could be perceieved as people under the right circumstances.

From Evolution To Art, Superstition, Ritual, Narrative &amp; Religion

These situated, evolved, narrative and social relations with place, environment and its constituents imprinted on human culture, and in particular imaginative, narrative, character-focussed activities - the rise of religion and art. TIE ALL THIS TO RESONANCE
UNCLEAR DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THESE, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO CULTURE AND EVOLUTION AND BELIEF: &quot;is religion... adaptive or is adapatiation religious&quot;, when is it religion and when is it art? When is it superstition and when is it religion? When is it believed? Lots of competing theories. Shows strength of autocosmic ambiguity. Dennett sees culture/religion (first ‘protoreligion’) arising directly from evolved faculties, and being subject to memetic revision (essentially resonance). Ryan also talks about myths and rituals changing over time, Dennett - &quot;social systems whose participants avow belief in a supernatural agent or agents whose approval is to be sought&quot; - &quot; belief is a genuinely curious and perplexing phenomenon,&quot; - “belief attribution appears beset with subjectivity, infected with cultural relativism, prone to &quot;indeterminacy of radical translation&quot; - Makes point in breaking the spell that things that were religion have now become cultural, if not aesthetic, practices. Halloween, as an example. Role of language? He sees it as arising from linguistic tendencies (Dennett) “&quot;folk religions emerged without conscious and deliberate design, just as languages emerged, by interdependent processes of biological and cultural evolution.” - Religions have &quot;belief in belief&quot; - distance from belief, the notion that something can be NOT believed. For rappaport, religion is co-extensive with evolution. With the invention of language. With adaptive measures. &quot;The belief that belief in God is so important that it must not be subjected to the risks of disconfirmation or serious criticism&quot;. The supernatural was essential to a subtle, sophisticated, and pervasive worldview, and was experienced on a daily basis by sane, intelligent people whose outlook on the universe was no less coherent than our own.” &quot;intuitively correct&quot; for some cultures rather than needing a creed. (Striving for unity) (rappaport) - &quot;Material and social conditions affect the willingness of the members of the community to participate in, amongst other things, the rituals that establish or accept the ultimate sacred postulates. &quot; - they were deployed in new ways, with complex symbolic meaning becoming attached to them.&quot; - Morris-Kay - body decoration as one of the earliest forms. Could have originated as camouflafe - Morris Kay - &quot;putative proto-art artefacts&quot; - “human cognition and symbolling activity, as well as anatomy, were fully modern by that time.&quot; Morris Kay talking about early art, “artistic behaviour”, not sure when - &quot;we have limited information on the origin and evolution of this aspect of human culture&quot;. such responses to the natural world were socialised and instrumentalised by &quot;early humans and their competency for culture&quot; (Mellman, 2012), their narratives made communal &quot;beyond individual understanding&quot; (Krippendorf, 1989). Dennett sees the externalisation of the intentional stance as the start of “proto-religion”, and religious belief. Morris-Kay - it is difficult to say where utilitarianism and art (boundaries) were found. &quot;The social context of humans has universal elements. Those relating to survival, reproduction and religion have been alluded to in this article. The religious element is specifically communicated to us through parietal art but the spiritual aspect portrayed here seems to encompass limited aspects of life and death.&quot; - Sugiyama's concept of narratives as means of &quot;cultural transmission&quot; (Boyer, 2001). - leading to &quot;a well-designed few&quot; concepts, characters and narratives – material which had 'resonance' - surviving through generations, changing from &quot;free-floating rationales&quot; to &quot;carefully-crafted reasons&quot;, “the evolved product of many adjustments… the raw materials of religion” (Dennett, 2007) - “Concentrate and institutionalise magical powers within a larger religious context.” Harari - move from spirits -&gt; gods in agricultural revolutions. With agriculture, we stopped looking at animals and started to look at ourselves. &quot; the evolution of technical skills, combined with the evolution of modern cognition, &quot; - &quot;The neural changes that provided our ancestors with the imagination to understand, through logic, the continued existence of something that is no longer visible, together with the anatomical attributes that enabled them to outrun prey over long distances, would have had a genuine evolutionary advantage. Without these survival-enhancing functional origins, it is unlikely that we would have the neural equipment to create art.&quot; - &quot;The social context of humans has universal elements&quot; – &quot;survival, death, reproduction, life' - &quot;allow for the possibility that most early art may have had a ritual or religious significance&quot; - What she calls ‘artistic behaviour’ - when did it become art? Not sure, intermingling of the cocnepts. We decorate useful objects, by Morris-Kay's standards. Though we lack documents about the earliest manifestations of narrative among higher primates, it is reasonable to assume that language capacities, storytelling abilities, and human cultures co-evolved in symbiotic relation with each other. Dautenhahn (2003) attributes the need to tell stories to the complex social organizations of humans, compared to that of apes, while Turner (1996) argues that humans did not start telling stories as the result of developing language, but rather that language was developed in response to the need to tell stories. Practicality of Greek religious belief (in LRB) - a &quot;modernist project&quot; - books that &quot;analyse religion as a social process&quot; - &quot;continuous with other forms of normative social activity, liable to change&quot; - both had a 'reflective dimension' - i.e. a layer of belief and a separation. Greek religion &quot;fundamentally sustained by tactical improvisation, opportunist reinvention and reverence for a tradition that no one owned or understood' - Cunning-folk “generally believed in their own powers” (smith). Lily Alexander - World-Building As Ritual - We have always done it - it is part of being human. A &quot;timeless network&quot;. IT connects us to our past, helps us handle big social problems through simulation and lets us look ahead to new possibilities for species. Lucien LEvy-Bruhl - &quot;prelogical consciousness&quot; - he was talking about &quot;fantasy [as] innate to this mental conciousness&quot;. She gives an overview of early twentieth centiry thought about fictionality, its role in art and religion, the origins of art. Coming from a concern of distinuighing fiction from reality. All these people. &quot;evolved into the narrative-visual worlds of literature and the arts&quot;. Saw early worlds as syncretic -combining art, philosophy and religion. No distinction. &quot;imaginary worlds were proto-art, proto-philosophy and a precursor to faith, helping humans to shape the most 'beneficial' forms of communication with their 'cooperative' gods” - can you &quot;unt[ie] the knots of fiction and reality&quot;.

Shamans as negotiators, mediators - evolved into artist-storyteller. Robert Layton - agriculture evolving 7000/9000 years ago. Criticises the “monolithic evolutionary or diffusionist stance” - the progress from primitive -&gt; civilised in art: he refutes this. His first chapter emphasises the lack of distinction between religious practice and art - aesthetics is a part of religion (p.8) - “the underlying iconology of art in smalll-scale socieities is frequently embedded in religion”. Dennett has an evolutionary perspective - lots of people disagree with it, including me: certainly it has changed, but IMPROVED? “Ideas and values” in art have a social function in small-scale societies, an everyday function. “The environment permits social systgems of a certain level of complexity to develop” - “art and ritual can form complementary media” - durkheim - “social life… is made possible only by a vast symbolism” Hitt - He is talking about &quot;art's relationship with nature&quot; - dates back &quot;to antiquity&quot; Harvey -

LRB article - Greek religion as in some ways playful, distanced but continuous with other social activity “continuous with other forms of normative social activity… characterised by the same impulses towards maintiaining group cohesion and hierarchies”



She talks about the &quot;Myth and ritual&quot; school (northrop frye, Campbell) - the ritualistic, repetitive structures of all narratives. She sees literature as emerging directly from ritual (with Greeks) - drama - deus-ex-machina. The process of ritual reflected in storytelling practicies (Catharsis, anagorisis, third-person perspective etc.). &quot;cornerstone postulate&quot; that drama came from ritual. Aristotle merely observing what was already happening in his culture.

Fritz and Tosello, 2015 - hutning and art were closely linked. We “venerated forms of landscape” - Macfarlane. Gibson - The early confluence of human and animal, no rigid distinction between them in tribal life. Shamans becoming animals to navigate sacred woprlds. Nature, in this view of the cosmos, is an extension of human culture, not an alien realm; even though humans and animals no longer speak the same language and must work at communicating, relationships between them are social and cultural, and imbued with vast spiritual significance.&quot; Relationships with animal populations, individual animals, forests, individual trees - a changing granularity of scale. Combined with the idea of the numinous. A genius in general was a specific instance of a general divine aura. Neal Alexander = Talking about “genius loci” - the guardian spirit, the spirit of place.

Westling - &quot;humans belong to the whole community of living creatures” - in many societies animism is closely associated with religious and mythological beliefs (Harvey, 2005). Narratives in religion (Finnern). -&quot;, biblical characters often serve as role models in regard to belief, behavior and experiences.&quot; church services resemble theater performances (see the overview of Meyer-Blanck 2011: 374–87). &quot;by helping people identify visual landmarks, stories can serve as a mnemonic and navigational tool. The famous &quot;songlines&quot; of Australian aborigines have, for instance, been said to help native populations orient themselves in a landscape that outsiders find disturbingly deprived of differentiating features.5 In animist, polytheistic, or simply rural systems of belief, narrative also differentiates space by associating certain regions with certain creatures about whom scary tales are told: haunted houses, nefarious water spirits, witches meeting deep in the forests, cemeteries visited by the undead, or elves dancing on the moor. Through all these phenomena, narrative connects to physical space.&quot; - Truth places - Place came to extol theme, to reinforce truths that were by no means self-evident - the nature of belief is contingent on a construction of reality around us - not on ‘facts’ that have no degree of distance. Competing ideologies. People MANUFACTURE places into sites of truth. “Kept alive the belief.. [that it is] real history and culturally important - “The very idea of landscape is a manifestation of a specific relationship between human subjects and their agency within space” - Talks about renaissance landscape as privileging the human perspective more. A history of animism as a useful conception of the system around us. Extended to environments, not just individual animals. From totem animals to gods, from totemism/fetishism to polytheism, where gods became &quot;incarnations of natural phenomena&quot;. living in their own realm, a mirror of the aspect of the real world that they represent. narrtives &quot;serve to clarify the man's symbolic map of reality&quot;. There must be intrinsic and embedded narratives in all fictional worlds, she says. The story activates the world.Not a &quot;landscaping hobby&quot; - 
&quot;The author argues that the architecture of Neolithic stone tombs acts as a kind of camera lens focussing attention on landscape features such as rock outcrops, river valleys, mountain spurs in their immediate surroundings. These monuments played an active role in socializing the landscape and creating meaning in it.&quot;

In stories that everyone can appreciate or even witness, they encode the environment.” - Layton - “horton sees social life as the source of the models small-scale communities frequently employ in order to conceptualise the nature of the les-readily grasped forces they experience”. Social life is more easily modelled/organised, whereas nature is not, therefore the former becomes the model for the latterr. Less applicable for big socieites, as social life is unpredictable.

NARRATIVE/CHARACTER-BASED: ‘Genius loci’, what Neal Alexander calls a ‘sense of place’, &quot;intermeshing of human and animal traits&quot; (Hodgson), animals as part of landscape, observation and storytelling as ritual practice for understanding and using animals, &quot;an intimate psycho-emotional interdependency with predators and prey&quot;, &quot;highly arousing/emotive image-based practices&quot;, also narrative. &quot;the existence of spirits, deities and gods, who represented early human's symbolic systems&quot;.

RELATIONSHIP WITH ENVIRONMENT BECOMES INSTRUMENTAL THROUGH RITUAL: Edward Shils (1975) stated that &quot; Sacred rituals, he suggested, are central to the power of all social institutions&quot;, &quot; “performance, formality, invariance, inclusion of both acts and utterances, and encoding by other than the performers”&quot; - In The Philosophy of Literary Form, rhetorician Kenneth Burke (1974: 4) reinforces our historical understanding of the magic of words: “The magical decree is implicit in all language; for the mere act of naming an object or situation decrees that it is to be singled out as such and such rather than as somethingother. Hence, I think that an attempt to eliminate magic would involve us in the elimination of the vocabulary itself as a way of sizing up reality.” - &quot;True rhetoric, Burke (1969) argued. “ Words have the power to send men to their death in war, abandon their home and families and adopt political structures that will enslave them.&quot; On Rappaport - &quot;just as liturgy confers extraordinary meaning on the experience of ritual participation, so the heightened quality of that experience imbues the associated liturgical representations with a significance beyond that of ordinary, discursive language.&quot; Interested in ecosystems, and rituals arising from that - mateiral and non-material, organic and not, animal and not, all interacting. A regulatory impulse. Designed to balance an ecosystem. Liturgy is reliable, can be used over and over again. &quot;the adaptive value of rituals in maintaining carrying capacity, the persistence of species, human nutritional well-being, and the frequency of warfare within small-scale societies.&quot; &quot; it constitutes an invariant sequence of acts and utterances (form), and (2) its participants must actually perform according to these invariant sequences. Rituals impose a standard of conduct that goes beyond the will of individual participants and constitutes the foundation of all convention. Ritual is the basic “social act.” &quot; - Rituals allow language to be tamed, to create trust. &quot;“…rituals and sequences of rituals as ‘liturgical orders’…” - Heavily related to language and evolves FROM language as a 'liturgical' function. &quot;…the performance of more or less invariant sequences of formal acts and utterances not entirely encoded by the performers logically entails the establishment of convention, the sealing of social contract, the construction of the integrated conventional orders we shall call Logoi…the investment of whatever it encodes with morality, the construction of time and eternity; the representation of a paradigm of creation, the generation of the concept of the sacred and the sanctification of conventional order, the generation of theories of the occult, the evocation of numinous experience, the awareness of the divine, the grasp of the holy, and the construction of orders of meaning transcending the semantic. &quot; - &quot;ritual is taken to be ground from which religious conceptions spring,&quot; - rappaport himself - Magick is the connexion of natural agents and patients, answerable each to other, wrought by a wise man, to the bringing forth of such effects as are wonderful to those that know not their causes. The start of magic. These were not just stories, or information relayed - they were active relationships that required constant, storied, narratively coherent interaction between place and person. This is the birth of ritual, magic and supersitious practices. “Prehistoric” roots of magic (Arcana Mundi). Place did things to us, so we needed to do things to place. Very rules-driven. Edward Shils (1975) stated that &quot; Sacred rituals, he suggested, are central to the power of all social institutions.&quot; - Such practices were invoked within the mental model of place, designed to be a social and controlled interaction with a place or a thing in order to placate it, force it to do something, persuade it, flatter it etc. They made sense within the narratives (Magic is a “complement to our ever-changing construction of reality” (Arcana Mundi), A “logic” to magic (arcana mundi)), a set of rules for interacting with the world. and allowed mankind a sense of control and agency in his relationship with place. Bringing the &quot;spiritual or supernatural forces&quot; which our animistic and anthropic tendencies had identified &quot;under the control of human agents&quot; (Frazer, 1891). Magic is all about control, influence and parlay - a fundamentally social relationship with the world and its animistic inhabitants. If social models of explanation are what suits, autocosmically, the understanding of landscape, then social models of action suit our understanding of how to influence it. Magic - a “technique grounded in a belief in powers located in the human soul and in the universe outside ourselves… imposing human will on nature”. Ritual, which he defines as &quot;the performance of more or less invariant sequences of formal acts and utterances not encoded by the performers,&quot; lays the framework for the creation and formulation of religion (Wolf,1999,21). Formality (cf Knight 1998, 1999) ensured that they were taken seriously, that they would work. And often they did work! The system SEEMED to respond back, even though it did not directly, though sometimes it did, for a different ‘interpretation’ (biosemiotics). “Structures and institutions that previously channelled spiritual belief into rituals that promoted collective identities.” - For rappaport, ritual is about balancing an 'cybernetic' ecosystem. Creating trust. Not just ways to explain the world – gave us frameworks within which to act towards it – ways that were narratively coherent, and had effects within that particular meaning-sphere. &quot;extraordinary meaning&quot; on own actions, not just what is observed. Stepanek &quot;ritual is taken to be ground from which religious conceptions spring,&quot; - rappaport himself These were not just stories, or information relayed - they were active relationships that required constant, storied, narratively coherent interaction between place and person. This is the birth of ritual, magic and supersitious practices. Types of ritual - consecration, apotropaism, purification, respect, gift-giving to place. Everyday things like food preparation, health concerns, navigation, hunting etc. Such practices were invoked within the mental model of place, designed to be a social and controlled interaction with a place or a thing in order to placate it, force it to do something, persuade it, flatter it etc. Magic is all about control, influence and parlay - a fundamentally social relationship with the world and its animistic inhabitants. If social models of explanation are what suits, autocosmically, the understanding of landscape, then social models of action suit our understanding of how to influence it. Magic - a “technique grounded in a belief in powers located in the human soul and in the universe outside ourselves… imposing human will on nature”. In particular – ritual – actions that were the ways that you could interact with those individuals, those personified spaces, &quot;the construction of orders of meaning transcending the semantic.&quot; Keep things in order – the sacred and the profane, the numinous, controlling life, interactions between self and space and others, through these categories. Ritual is the basic “social act.” &quot; Magic is a “complement to our ever-changing construction of reality” (Arcana Mundi) allowed mankind a sense of control and agency in his relationship with place. Bringing the &quot;spiritual or supernatural forces&quot; which our animistic and anthropic tendencies had identified &quot;under the control of human agents&quot; (Frazer, 1891).Heavily related to language and evolves FROM language as a 'liturgical' function. They are &quot;invariant sequences of formal acts and utterances&quot; &quot;establishment of convention&quot;, &quot;the construction of the integrated conventional orders&quot;, have specific effects, &quot;formality, invariances, inclusion of both acts and utterances, and encoding by other than the performers”&quot; - i.e. are SOCIAL. A &quot;social contract... the establishment of convention&quot;. What Rappaport calls &quot;liturgy&quot; – &quot;establish and constitute order&quot;, &quot;directives&quot; – &quot;heightened quality of experience... a significance beyond that of ordinary, discursive language&quot;, repeatable &quot;Rituals impose a standard of conduct that goes beyond the will of individual participants and constitutes the foundation of all convention. &quot; Appealing to rules. Towards characters. They are social actions, fundamentally. generated by the HADD yielded candidates to press into service as decision aids, in divination, or as shaman's accomplices, in health maintenance, for instance. Fixed rules. &quot;They must cause an event to happen through means that are symbolic rather than material. Yet the event is not merely a symbolic, but a literal transformation, and it can affect material objects.&quot; Ryan talks about a 'religious' point of view that distinguishes between profane everyday and the sacred - how does this relate to the idea of systematising? &quot;Ritual achieves its efficiency through a manipulation of these hidden forces&quot; a &quot;fine line between ritual and superstition&quot;. Both rituals and narrative make us human by building community: ritual coordinates activity into a collaborative event, while narrative requires joint attention to the words of the storyteller.' - ritual and narrative both make sense of the world. - Points that ritual tries to act on the senselessness of life, narrative to reflect upon it. She says ritual is symbolic rather than practical - is this true? WHen did it stop becoming practical? Coming on to re-sestablish myth, to tell stories and re-live times through enactment - like narrative. She talks about the difference between believing in rituals and 'just going through the motions'. Ritual goes beyond representation, and enacts things symbolically through performance. The boundaires of 'symbolism' are very hazy. Again, this is about the concept of belief. says it is a 'chicken-and-egg question' as to whether myth or ritual came first - stories about the world, or rituals to enact the worlld first? - She says it is more ambi-generative, with rituals spawning narratives and vice-versa. But narrative gives birth to ritual more commonly. Rituals based on myth. Calls it a &quot;feedback loop&quot; - She points out that the definition of ritual is in flux - but perhaps we can talk about a 'ritualivity'? Koentiz calls ones with lessons rather than endings (about phenomena) &quot;etiological oral narratives&quot;. The role of ambiguity, need to make clear, in ritualistic, narrative, autocosmic relationships with landscapes. The world does not always speak back. Lily Alexander - A semi-symbolic world - uses interactive media - in here &quot;3we often act physically and physiologically&quot; - We interact, use our bodies, react with real emotion and bodily response. - &quot;semi-symbolic, semi-real participation&quot; - started with early man's ritual, now we do it today. Talks about rituals being important to FWB - provide the symbolic ingredients of rtiauls, the spaces in which they take place, and narrative structure. a &quot;transformative symblic space&quot; is created.rituaks are &quot;operational systems&quot; of early religious beliefs - they enabled acting in world, but also built that world through action. &quot;the essence of ritual is the synchronization of the community&quot; and going into &quot;unfamiliar territories&quot; to grow personally and enter next stages of life. States that ritual requires your phyisology to involved in other worlds - in order for it to work - just like with books. &quot;novel physical experiences&quot;. But rituals do not have to be oversensoryload. Can be everyday as well. Ties it to defamiliarization of formalists and Aristotle's 'astonishment' - need enchantment for this - &quot;art-as-ritual&quot;. talks about &quot;indirect&quot; communication as part of ritual. &quot;Symbolic gestures&quot; and resulting &quot;sign language&quot; of gods through environment. For her, rituals enact new social identities for communitys and individuals, improving society. Ryan On Ritual talks about the links between language and magic. &quot;Just as narrative divides the world into distinct symbolic domains, ritual relies on divisions in space, time, and society. &quot; - Mountains Of The Mind - One goes to environments to challenge them, to perform within them. Mountain-climbing as an example; “an epic endeavour: an encounter with the utmost of all foes, Nature” (Macfarlane). How we imagine mountains separately from engaging with them.Pitting oneself against a character. “Glaciers open themselves up to you when you look closely at them.” “Invisible attacks of altitude” (character as enviro). Modernity provides a luxury to look at landscapes as something other than utilitarian (p.14). “The space felt vast and malevolently active, as though it were inhaling me; pulling me off into its emptiness.” “When we look at a landscape, we do not see what is there, but largely what we think is ther.” - “What we call a mountain is thus in fact a collaboration of the physical forms of the world with the imagination of humans - a mountain of the mind” - “They do not kill deliberately, nor do they deliberately please: any emotional properties which they possess are vested in them by human imaginations” - “They are also the objects of human perception; they have been imagined into existence down the centuries. - “Not the ways that people have gone into the mountains, but the ways that they have imagined they were going into them” Highly related to Nan Shepherd. “For many nineteenth century mountaineers, then, being among the mountains was little more than a roleplaying game… in which grown men could play at danger” Weber/McF - ‘wonder’ is a state in which we are comfortable with not knowing. Macfarlane states that we invest thoughts and emotions into landscape in Wild Places (smith’s reference). Gods as communicative artefacts. Layton - “ritual as a mode of enacting religious thought”. Drawing on Lienhardt - don’t necessarily believe that events/phenomena in the world are changed by ritual, but rather that ritual will change the tribe’s perception of those events. The height of symbolism. Tilley - “Landscapes have agency in relation to persons&quot; - Mikmaq View Of Animals - 'AS siblings and persons', 'reciprocity' in animal-human relationships - as part of the environment, Humans as both part of (engaging in) the environment, but also distinct from it through the necessity of perception of self/other (same in digital environments) - Animistic outlook - 'everything is alive' &quot;geographic locations can have an identity, personality, and spirit&quot; - Animals willingly sacrificing themselves through respect. No overfishing etc. - balance. Harvey Talks as animism necessitating ritual behaviour to navigate its fundamentally social aspect. Harvey 0 &quot;performative acts in which people engage with other species or with other things. Bruce Janz talks about how place is a &quot;spontaneous event rather than... a static, neutral stage&quot;

Continue Through History


  - Cunning-folk “generally believed in their own powers” (smith).
ANNE SITTING AT A MIDPOINT - examples of how narrative, ritualistic relationships to ecosystemic ecologies surrounding us, both animals and whole environments, evolved, particularly as art and religion became more separate. The “long 18th century” (Davies) - time of social upheaval, battle between science and magic, storytelling, anthropomorphism and ritual still a big part of life - a place where the cracks show - It was in this period that &quot;the world of popular belief and custom&quot; (Hutton, 1999) competed with science, the state and religion for control of people's imaginations. This was perhaps best symbolised by the passing of the Witchcraft Act in 1735, a rubicon which alters the crime of witchcraft from one of diabolical interference to that of an &quot;explicitly fraudulent practice&quot; (Davies, 2007). A really messy time, science and art and religion coalescing. Different systems, different landscapes. Demonology ended at end of 1600s, before “a working system of belief at the height of its powers”. A complicated time. &quot;religions became domesticated&quot; - not just ideas we had - now we curated them. TIE TO RESONANCE FIRST PARA: A reference to Anne’s world, the environment she lives in, her dislike of the moor, the particulars of people’s movements - space and place a big part of this. Anne living at a time when the changing relationship between person and place was particularly heightened. Particularly its relationship to our imagination. Bothy project residency stanage edge visit. @ start - Anne lying at a crossroads. The view on the moor - nature as dangerous, as possessed of intent. Unpredictable. All around react to it in different ways. People’s idea of the moor but few people go out there anymore. The pixies she lists. The cunning fol;k she lists.  Draw it back to the moor.
EVERYDAY SUPERSTITIONS - the pixies which she lists (beliefs in fairies, demons, witches), religion, mixed with everyday religious belief - “the incomprehensible yet present activity of a higher power” - “The whole air is full of souls”. Ankarloo and Clark 1999 - “send dreams, signs and illnesses to men” . “Fear of things invivisble is the natural seed of that which every one in himself calleth religion.” Proceeding from a tradition. Not as gone as everybody said it was (examples?) - Fictional characters tied to natural systems, lying behind natural systems. Petrified rocks, prevalance of ‘the devil’s’ placenames in a dictionary of english folklore. The role of the cunning folk - instrumentalising and narratively contextualising nature - “Magic was essentially a way of dealing with all sorts of problems in life” (Arcana Mundi) - Using the suspicions and imaginations of their clients to divine properly, to employ the placebo effect, to give proper narrative context to their imaginings. Medical has always had a lot of superstitions - the body as unknown system - body as enviornment - character as environment. “. “The incorporation of christian beliefs and prayers”. ‘Low’ magic. Theatrics - an accomplice dressed as a devil in a pit. Clark points out that belief in witchcraft was in no way universal - but it was powerful. But fitted in with the entire worldview on nature, history, religion and politics. Hutton (95) links the sorts of ailments that charmers focus on to the human nervous system - rapport with patient led to psychosomatic response - Theo Brow (1950s) - noted success rate to be total. “Thinking With Demons” is a very apt title. “Described and accounted for contemporary problems in what seemed an accurate way and presented attractive solutions to them.” Resonance of the old beliefs coming through, despite science. Point to modern studies of ritual being affective (Keinan, Norton, Norton and Gino, Vamos). “Amalgam of fortune-teller, astrologer, herbalist, medical doctor, veterinary surgeon and witch-doctor. They could detect stolen property; identify witches, thieves and future husbands; procure love; unbewitch the bewitched; dispense protective charms; and at least some could cast horoscopes.” (Harding)“Fiscally stagnated agrarian communities”. Keith Thomas suggests, the ‘cunning man’s greatest asset was his client’s imagination; and in view of what is known today about the potentialities of any cure in which both doctor and patient have complete faith, its power cannot be. Familiars as characters, as real ‘persons’ - a representative, a psychopomp, of these systems that underlie everyday life. Had an intimate, emotional relationship with them (millar, wilby). Most often animals. “General popular disengagement from fairies during the eighteenth cnetury” - not referred to as much anymore. Fictional characters tied to natural systems, lying behind natural systems. Spontaneous folk belief, not based on elite writings: (Wilby) - not an ‘elite construction’. Part of a continuum which included many different sorts of spirits - (Wilby) “Categories of spirit overlapped considerably.” - Familiar denoted “both the witch’s demonic spirit and… personal helping spirits” - “But familiars and fairies were believed to possess a range of supernatural powers that were considered capable of affecting almost any aspect of human life” - Parallel to the hobman, “living alone… either alongside humans in their houses” - “The affectionate and intimate relationship often found between the witch/cunning woman and her familiar/fairy” - “Others claimed to encounter them on a more regular basis, commonly developing a particularly close relationship with one or more spirits.” - “Its associations had been traditionally tied to theological and folkloric contexts: It was the domain of sin, death, and decay; the stage for witchcraft; the habitat of weird and ferocious creatures” (Miller 3) - Anne as confusing old and new - gravity as an intentional force. 206 - charts the diminishing anthropomorphism of religion since ancient times. The indoors the only way to escape it. Re. Familiars (rifford) - “independent life of its own, it remains closely linked to the individual.” swamp dragon talks about historical dualism. Most interesting thing about all this is that, as with the autocosmic tendency generally, there are few distinct lines between imaginative relationships with place in aesthetic and non-aesthetic practices. These characters, and these narratives, to these elements of the populace, not only had a direct effect on people's lives, but could be directly affected and influenced by the individual through the use of charms, architectural wards (Davies, 2007, Hoggard, 2016), healing practises (Harding, 2016) and visits to 'cunning folk' such as Anne (Davies, 2009), who would &quot;provide... magical services&quot; and provide &quot;attractive solutions&quot; to their problems (Clark, 1999). As with all religious or superstitious belief, these narratives provided imaginative stimuli to a populace that, like all human beings on an evolutionary level, desired to know how the world worked, and provided them with models which were satisfactorily &quot;coherent&quot; with what they experienced, in Oatley's sense of the word. They were extrapolated at the individual and social levels, and possess strong elements of what we consider important to all stories today; engaging plots and 'resonant' characters such as God, the Devil and the witch (Roper, 2000). In a similar, yet more direct manner than modern, aesthetic narratives, they excited the evolved survivalist strategies of the human mind and body in a confusing and complex world; providing instruction and example of dangers and opportunities which chimed with the social context of the day; and, most importantly, provided means of instructional agency for those who wished to capitalise on these opportunities or avoid these dangers. By performing ritual or superstitious actions, in context with these narratives, the world was made a &quot;safer, less hostile place&quot; (Wilson, 2016). Succour and understanding were offered by both religious teaching and superstitious traditions, providing the elements for a lively extrapolation of the &quot;storyworld&quot; (Ryan, 2014) in which they found themselves living and the characters that inhabited it; and the ritualistic behaviour at the heart of both religious and superstitious practices provided them with a coherently-true agency in that world, and with those characters, that would allow them to survive it. We were distanced from it. “social consensus” about magic. (arcana mundi). “It is hard enough for the scholar to know what he himself believes. It is next to impossible for him to discover what other people really believe.” - “. For these people the forest spirit is a very real thing. It is not the folklorist's job to confirm or deny this reality.” - lofstedt While it seems clear that religion, a key antecedent (even in Wolf's view) to modern aesthetics, provides a link between mundane and aesthetic imagination, the concept of 'belief' provides a further disjunction. On the surface, religious and superstitious imaginative participation lacks 'aesthetic distance' because it is 'believed'. It is something which is serves a didactic function directly connected to 'real' life, and that the nature of 'faith' lacks the distance which is required (in Wolf's conception) to engage with a work of narrative art. However, some study of the nature of 'belief' in religious practice muddies the concept, and reveals further the continuum between religious imaginative incorporation and the 'reception contract' of literary theory. Plate (2010), following on from the work of Huizinga (1955) and Caillois (1961), considers the practice of religion to be the playing of a game, a &quot;serious business&quot; &quot;in a world that is all their own&quot; (Paden, 2015) which nonetheless includes an implicit, perhaps unconscious detachment. To see religious beliefs as uncomplicated 'credulity' ignores the aesthetic element of their construction and materia and, as Boyer posits, makes great understatement of the human capacity for imagination. It displays a &quot;problematic&quot; (2013), anthropological arrogance towards the minds of those in the past or a more 'primitive' present, such as &quot;traditional societies&quot; (2013). Boyer reminds us that religious beliefs rely on very spurious or partial evidence, and that the &quot;complex cognitive processes&quot; (2013) involved in maintaining unequivocal belief in things which seem only tangentially related seems to be logically bankrupt. Alongside Tanya Luhrmann, he puts forward a concept of religious belief, and the general imagining which both originated it and sustained it, remarkably similar to current theories of literary reception and to philosopher Tamar Gendler's concept of 'alief' (2008), whereby we act, feel and perform actions as if we believed something were true, even though subconsciously we know that it is not. Objective truth of religion, for Luhrmann and Boyer, is irrelevant, as with other fictions; what matters is the &quot;reflective truth&quot; (2013); how the aesthetics and socio-narrative cachets of such beliefs can be maintained, how stable the 'reception contract' between individual and belief system is within their &quot;emotional community&quot; (Rosenwein, 2002) (a concept that bears striking resemblance to Fish's &quot;interpretative communities&quot; (1982), and whether the narratives and characters are, indeed, 'resonant'; how well they pander to our &quot;evolutionary adaptive cognitive functions&quot; which Kapogiannis and his colleagues (2009) see as fundamental to religious belief; &quot;drawing on associative facilities constitutive of consciousness, and experiencing them in ways which are neither entirely recreational nor entirely credulous.&quot; Often, such a strategy has a direct 'subsistence' utility in Sugiyama's conception: in my research for Anne's narrative, I came across Roberta Harding's account of gallows superstitions in 18th century England; an 'emotional community' where a sympathetic belief in the power of the dead's touch to heal served as a psychosocial response to the lack of healthcare available for the poor (2016). Nor can we, as Wolf attempts to do, draw the 'division of aesthetic distance' between the past and the present; religious belief, superstition and other troubling epistemological states cannot &quot;be relegated to a previous period in human history&quot; (Subbotsky, 2014) by &quot;simplistic, deterministic views of a transition from a sacralized to a secular universe&quot; (Gaskill, 2017). Despite our innate sense of historical superiority, we are biologically and neurologically little changed from those early humans that Dennett described, nor from the 'credulous' inhabitants of the 18th century that Anne and her 'spyrit' treated (Davies, 1999). “Reason has not ended our relationship with magic” (Davies, 2009), and superstitions “continue to be part of the cultural landscape” (Harding, 2016). Studies have consistently shown high levels of “pervasive” 'belief' in paranormal phenomena such as ghosts, aliens or the power of astrology, even amongst supposedly 'rational' people such as science students (Sugarman et al, 2011). Superstitious beliefs can greatly affect the decisions of 'rational' people to donate organs (Vamos, 2010) and assess their own health (Boardman and Sonnenberg, 2014), even though we have the educational and cultural 'distance' from these beliefs-as-fictions. Religion, in particular, being the most likely the 'joining point' between 'unaesthetic' and 'aesthetic' narrative in human history (which, according to Mellman, happened extremely recently (2012)), shows significant ambivalence when it comes to the concept of 'belief', with research pointing to something quite like the playful &quot;generation of temporary belief&quot; that Childs &amp; Fowler see as the 'reception contract' with narrative artworks, rather than a completely hermetic, unimpeachable and undistant 'delusion' as has traditionally been thought. &quot;Thirdly, and most importantly, people continued to believe in witchcraft as a source of illness.&quot; &quot;Cunning-folk were the nexus of a complex set of beliefs which sought to explain, prevent and reverse misfortune. &quot; Tied to natural things, natural remedies - the witch as a manifestation of nature. Witch as a depersonalised issue of nature.
SCIENCE AND ‘ELITE’ CONCERNS - the ‘sublime’ (starting with Burke and Kant) - reactions that we less ‘low’ to environment. Burke saw it as aesthetic (pain/threat), Kant saw it as a response of reason. &quot;pre-Romantics in the eighteenth century saw in the sublime irrationality, a connection which gave them an opportunity to fight the predominant rationalism of the epoch.&quot; Tied to spiritualism (Mr. Knole) - “a subjective encounter with something which is absolutely great or absolutely menacing” - Sublime in art - representing sublime objects or the &quot;avowal of the failure of language&quot; - the low were also dealing with the sublime - &quot; We can list some genres apt to evoke the sublime: odes, hymns, psalms, benedictions, maledictions, epitaphs, invocations, swearing, puzzles, etc. (cf. Deguy). The aforementioned linguistic means all presuppose an encounter of the subject with something beyond his or her imagination&quot;. The sublime is the systematic. - Riding and llewellyn - &quot;an expression of the unknowable&quot; Compared to understanding nature in superstitious ways. For Burke definitely an aesthetic response - but a response in real life, TO real life. - &quot;On the simplest level, a sublime experience while crossing the Alps is an engagement with landscape&quot; - disorder, unknowability, complexity. The sublime was an aesthetic response to landscape in the age of reason, which sought to break from earlier, superstitious responses to landscape amongst those who could safely observe landscape and whose lives were not bound up in it. - &quot;an exercise in daunting emptiness and the evocation of an alienating landscape to provoke a sense of sublime solitude, a central theme in the Romantic poetry of Wordsworth, Coleridge and others. &quot; Leading on to the sublime, the Romantic - a change in how we perceived nature, tied to both old superstitions, artistic sensibility and new science. A new way of appreciating, imagining and interacting with nature. The characters faded, but the forces did not. In a way, it was going back to animism - the mountain as malevolent. Greatness beyond all. Related to the ‘picturesque’. Distinct from beauty. Addison. Away from reason. “An agreeable kind of horror”. Viewing these mountains.Burke said beauty and sublimity were mutually exclusive, anda rt could not be sublime.For Kant, beauty has boundaries, and sublime is boundless. Compared to picturesque - coming about with Gilpin in 1782 - . Sublime is about the death of reason in aesthetic judgement - baser human reactions.Pictureque is between beauty and sublime - a way to frame and bound landscape to be affected by it. Go around Britain, look at landscapes - oppose the Grand Tour. Pcturesque more organic than orderly. The ballad. Martin for a history of sublime - The sublime as a function of the landscape’s danger and fragility, its greatness, both as itself and representing something else. Sublime - an evolution of earlier imaginative engagement with landscape - “presents danger without causing harm”. For Kant - we can reason something’s infinity without imagining it. The ultimate failure of imagination to understand another. Both religion and science &quot;involve making logical distinctions, categorizing events and objects, organizing conceptual hierarchies along different levels of abstraction, and engaging in systematic comparisons and contrasts. &quot; People going to and being and acting in landscapes that did not have to. Edmund Burke - first sublime writer - “Burke was interested in our psychic response to things” “Perhaps the unknown exists most perfectly in anticipation, in the imagionation.” - if we go to places, we become disappointed. The imagination is best for landscapes and characters. Do we want characters to be be familiar or strange? Both! We started to explorer out into space, and down into the “recesses of the human psyche”- “delighted ibn chaos, intensity, cataclysm, great size, irregularity”. swamp dragon talks about historical dualism - Awlbatch as sublime representative of moor =- picturesque - painting p[ictures of him. The mill as enlightenment, mechanisation. - Wants to get away from superstitious past. - Romanticism in title page. - Moor covered in fences from absentee landlord. The tendency to read human feelings into the landscape in poetry was, in fact, so common in the nineteenth century that the art critic John Ruskin (1897, 3: 161-77) designated it as the &quot;pathetic fallacy.&quot; Yet he later provides several examples of his own of agency in landscape. Negative Capability, when directed to non- human entities. As he writes in one of his letters: &quot;if a Sparrow come before my Window I take part in its existince [sic] and pick about the Gravel&quot;. Bogost defines between mathematical and dynamic sublimity - the function of time and movement makes a game environment dynamically sublime. It depends whether you are interacting with the systems as to which sublimity is relevant. “Magic is not, essentially, anything; it is what, in particular cutlrual settings, it is construed to be.” Witchcraft a “relative concept” (686). Bailey - the boundaries of superstition and belief. An “amphibious” response. Enlightenment -&quot;rationality conquering nature in the forms of modern science... leading irrevocably to the disenchantment of the world&quot; (eco and geo). The Search For The Picturesque Review - Landscape as enframed, as an aesthetic object, as a representation to be admired rather than lived within. From 1740s onwards there developed a 'taste' for picturesque landscapes,. Before Gilpin, meant 'picturable': after Gilpin, meant beautiful, novel etc. Joseph Addison 'novel or uncommon'. Beautiful,Sublime,Picturesque Review - the &quot;beautiful,&quot; the &quot;sublime,&quot; and the &quot;pic- turesque,&quot; a related trio of eighteenth-century British aesthetic ideas.The difference between rugged and smooth was part of it. Smooth is beauty (Burke), picturesque is rugged, sublime is terrifying Picturesque was part of a way of imaginatively engaging with landscapes, of framing, considering them, imbuing them with character, building mental models of them. Picturesque, Sublime &amp; Beautiful were three relatively new ways of imaginatively engaging with landscape that represented a break with previous attempts and paved the way for future movements such as the Romantics, and indeed scientific engagements with the natural world. The natural world, in each of these, was treated as a narrative/aesthetic object - something to be considered in a particular way, to be approached in a particular way and interacted with. This is, at a base level, little different from how environments have always been treated - as imaginatively engaging entities that can be traversed and interacted with - but reflected particular artistic, political and social trends at the time. Patricularly with the sublime, the landscape became something which could be acted upon and could act upon man - hence the feelings that it evoked. Picturesque 18th Century Debate - &quot;he appropriated that view and framed it in a way that controlled and orchestrated each viewer's experience&quot; - Its about visual qualities of landscapes being categorised imaginatively. &quot;The term was first introduced by the Reverend William Gilpin in his 1768 treatise An Essay on Prints. There Gilpin defined the picturesque as &quot;a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty which is agreeable in a picture&quot; Linked to the Grand Tour, the heritage of landscapes, the emotional and intellectual implications of viewing them. Capability Brown as a landscape artist. Lack of formality A mixture of gardening and painting. Related to Burke's work on the sublime. Became about what a landscape did to you. Obscu rity, power, privation, vastness, difficulty, magnificence, loudness, and more were among the qualities associated with the sublime&quot; &quot;The beautiful, by contrast, aroused the passion of
love and was associated with such qualities as smallness, smoothness, gradual variation, delicacy, and clear but mild coloration.&quot; Picturesque sits between sublime and beautiful.&quot; roughness, sudden variation, and irregularity as the three hallmarks of the picturesque&quot;. Price saw it in nature, and said that it went beyond the visual to include all our senses. Price and Knight Knights difference is that the picturesque is in the eye of the beholder, not the object itself. Tied to painting in Knight's view. All three tied to painting. Part of the history of taste. Landscape being codified in the AESTHETIC, detached from religion.&quot;. In overturning the aesthetic dogmatism of the seventeenth century, the eighteenth-century cult of the picturesque helped prepare the way for the aesthetic liberation of the romantic era&quot; Andrews - Landscapes that reminded them of paintings. - Also comes from older British literary traditions - Landscape painting becoming more popular, less debased, in C18th. Producing sketches of the landscapes themselves. about framing the landscapes in certain ways. Leading onto the Romantics &quot;the gradual shift in taste from an Augustan sensibility which sees the world as a display of moral and political emblems to a picturesque sensibility which emphasizes instead each perceiver's emotional and aesthetic responses to the natural world.&quot; Andrews sees the Picturesque/beautiful/sublime as a philosophical untethering of the certainty of mans dominion over the natural world. Andrews claims that the icturesque tourist was &quot;typically a gentleman or gentlewoman engaged in an experiment in controlled aesthetic response to a range of new and often intimidating visual experiences&quot; - Nayar  Talking about the emergence of the 'human sciences' (human exceptionalism) during of Enlightenment (Foucault said this in The Order Of Things) Hitt -Enlightenment &quot;an age that ushered in empiricism, natural theology and natural history&quot;. In that time &quot;the paradoxical recognition that we both master and are mastered by the nonhuman world&quot;.  Majorie Hope Nicolson 'Mountain Glory' - before 17th century mountains were dangerous grotesques. The sublime is oxymoronic - both feel horror, panic, privation, threat AND joy, exaltation. Hitt - THe picturesque was a way to appreciate the mystery of wild nature, but it also destroyed it. &quot;domesticates the wild landscape&quot;. Picturesque was a dominating discipline.&quot;the Fullness of that Immense-one&quot; - the BEING of nature in Shaftesbury For Hitt, the neoclassical notions of nature are an 'internal' rather 'external' - an ideal accessible by imagination and reason. &quot;double gesture&quot; of reverence and mastery towards nature - &quot;the pastoral idealizes and fictionalizes nature&quot;. Hitt - Complicated relationship between 'nature and &quot;nature&quot;' - science on one side, romantics on the other - how do we represent nature accurately? Or do we revel in the imagination's constructions?  In the 18th century big debates about the nature of knowledge, how we know a real thing, the relationship between mental image and the real - Locke and Hume writing about the inadequacy of direct experience - Thomas Wieskel - the sublime etc was a quasi-religious reaction to Enlgithenment. GOd had to be placed in a sensory universe, in nature again, in the vastness of space - in nature-through-science. Hitt - &quot;both are responses to the opacity of nature&quot; The overview here is that the 18th century had a complex, paradoxical relationship with space, ecology, landscape, religion and science. Never one thing or the other. Sees the Beautiful (in a Kantian sense) about a continuity between mind and nature, the mind and real. All of it was about &quot;the complexity... of the relationship between nature and the human mind&quot; Adler - &quot;the faux ruin which became a common landscape motif in the eighteenth century&quot;&quot;appropriation of the ruin metaphor will be the one which attempts just such a symbiosis between nature and art&quot; - forest motif with columns
&quot;Romanticism, the period in which the ruin last held sway over the western aesthetic imagination&quot;
ELITE MAGIC AND PRACTICE - science and magic wrapped up together, &quot;[of an] identity with&quot; and preceded by the natural philosophy of the 17th century and the &quot;natural magic&quot; (Clark, 1999) of the 15th and 16th centuries, reflected early challenges of the church's hegemony in the mental life of the country, as well as an official, or &quot;elite&quot; (Wilby, 2005) disdain for superstitious beliefs. Watching the systems of nature - Montaigne’s Watchmaker. A new way to understand and parse natural systems - away from religion. Natural theology - “to scrutinise nature, to discern its patterns and its idiosyncrasies, was thus a form of worship”. It had an “identity with science” - studying the natural world as a system of secrets, it was “exoteric.” Keckermann - “extraordinary virtues… in natural things” - joining and combining. “Natural magic as a science of the occult… occult causation” - battled against superstition, but both attempts to know the unknown. Davies - “natural magic was considered by many intellectuals to be a branch of the sciences, as it dealt with the occult powers within nature.” References neo-platonism (char as enviro). Low magic and high magic distinction. Needed to deal with a natural world that needed comprehension - a “causal scheme” (231). ‘Mechanical’ philosophy came later - Cartesian mechanomorphism - did not remove “occult qualuities”. “Natural magic” as “applied science” - unexplained but natural phenomena that are seen as magic. Owen Davies - natural magic was well-tolerated - “hidden or occult natural forces existed in God’s universe that could be tapped by humans”. P 163- quaots perrault calling rhe Devil a great naturalist. Nature was his realm of influence. Superstition could be demonic - it tried to transcend nature’s dvine laws, originated in devils, go beyond “ascertainable limits” of nature. “The devil was invoked whenever methods of acquring knolwedge assumed causal connections in nature that did not exist”. God gave everything its place in nature - “natural divination” (scientific observation) vs. “Diabolocial divination” (Caspar Peucer). Demonology opposed to “natural magic” - the natural world causing “mira” - unexplained things. A neoplatonist position. Was natural wisdom - “knowledge of hidden things”. The resonance of the Devil. Fictional characters tied to natural systems, lying behind natural systems. Darwin influenced by Lyell’s work - “the world is the result of natural laws and forces that are active and observable in the present-day world” - Science as “our own peculiar form of magic” (arcana mundi) - Ethologists speak about design - mean how a system self-regulates mechanisms. Spinoza's ideas on god i nnature - &quot;an atheist or a pantheist&quot;. “Locate the secret forces in nature” Science and magic interrelate. Lily Alexander - she gives an overview of romanticism - drawing back in early religious practices and beliefs to art. Cities as environs as well. The sublime is a border between imagination and reason - an autocosmic overwhelming. Largeness, fear, misunderstanding. Use the sublime as the link to fiction. The sublime is different from the beautiful in landscape - (kant) - nonsensical, non-understandable. Can a videogame environment be sublime, as we CAN understand it and find its borders? Sublime - we feel terror and awe because the totality of something, and its place in the logos, extends beyond the bounds of our viewpoint, of our percepton,. (drawing on Kant). For Romantics, language could not grasp it. Going beyond, the unknowability of the system. Taylor outlines how this transcendent worldview changed through the exercise of discipline and reform, which gradually tamed uncontrolled and supernatural forces. Coalescing in the Reformation, and affected through a growing middle class, this process of discipline corralled disruptive beliefs and isolated the now buffered self from nature, with the aim of securing a well-ordered and industrious society. 

Later Conceptions

Bottom Line: The narrative/imaginative engagement with environment, particularly through art (mixed interestingly with religion) is alive and well. A systemic narrative engagement, that is often characterised.
 A Larger Series Of Trends Outside Fictive Narrative Arts - turning towards a non-human-focussed, systemic/networked, holistic appreciation and understanding of environment/ecology.

Environments/Landscapes In Fiction: The importance of space. Mark J. Wolf, refer back to cosmos/worldliness from chapter 1. Interesting link to the ‘designedness’ of space. &quot;Lotman views the world of a story as structured by a system of relations between symbolic domains delimited by spatial boundaries.&quot; For Wolf, we expand the worlds too (in Tolkien review) through reader participation. &quot;Wolf’s key argument here is since Plato’s Republic, imaginary worlds have existed for their own sake, not merely as narrative settings.&quot; - perdurant, just like characters. Imaginary worlds as &quot;transmedia entities, the receptacles of interrelated narratives, or objects of study and interest in themselves&quot;. Calls it &quot;subcreation studies&quot; - tolkien's term. He explores them through linguistic, social, cultural, anthropological, geographic, political - &quot;world consistency&quot; - rodrigo lesa and joao araujo and &quot;world completeness&quot; (benjamin j. robertson). Use them for lots of reasons - as uchronias, as political experiments (edward castronova), as satire (carstocea), as places to escape (lars konzack), as participatory (freeman), as dystopias. Fictional worlds are important to narrative art, in and of themselves. Possible Worlds Theory (Ryan, from website) - &quot;accessibility relation&quot; to the real world. Tied to how we percieve environment - deeply tied not just to place, but systemic space/place.Only really need to touch on it. Possible worlds as &quot;ontologically complete entities&quot; - &quot;a matter of missing information, not of ontological deficiency&quot; (some dissent to this idea, she shows). Alison (GS) - “Wuthering Heights as environment as part of story”. “According to Lotman, narrative is born when a character crosses the boundary between these symbolically charged spaces: “A plot can always be reduced to a basic episode—the crossing of the basic topological border in the plot’s spatial structure” ([1970] 1977: 238).” - “all narratives imply a world with spatial extension, even when spatial information is withheld” - “An important aspect of the cognitive mapping of narrative texts is the attribution of symbolic meaning to the various regions and landmarks of the narrative world.” Jenkins' idea of a story as a 'body of information' rather than 'temporal structure' - Often just seen as settings for human stories. Lawrence Durrell - “You write… as if the landscape were more important than the characters’ - seeing characters ‘almost as functions of landscape’ - narratologists have long privileged time over space, narrative space remains a relatively unexplored territory. Dictionary of Imaginary places - place as character - worthy of being considered on its own - Jones on stage design - “To bring into being a powerful non-being” - Hedda Gabler’s room is almost a “presence, a mood” - “it says nothing, but gives everything” (not a character for him, though). Celia Pearce - - LOTR stories were “developed as a means to explore the worlds”. Always framed in fiction. Always designed. ”Landscapes are culture before they are nature; constructs of the imagination projected on to the wood and water and rock___But it should also be acknowledged that once a certain idea of landscape, a myth or vision, establishes itself in an actual place, it has a peculiar way of muddling categories, of making metaphors more real than their referents, of becoming, in fact, part of the scene”. Laure-Ryan in Why WOrlds Now talks about the history of possible worlds theory in science, art, religion. 'World' not meaning planet, but &quot;everything that exists&quot;. Possible Worlds started as a philosophical exercise - a way to explain how imagined worlds could function and be spoken about. With speech act theory. Worlds can be non-actual, just like people. &quot;the exact nature of actuality is open to debate&quot;. “But Lewis' work was important because it meant truth and falsity could be talked about when talking about possible worlds - we could discuss them _as_ worlds. Breaking down of older ideas that kept distance from fictional works as important - Lewis tried to collapse that idea of real and irreal, and distance. Not just &quot;the suspension of the rules governing speech acts&quot;. Worlds are both immersive and interactive, in Ryan's conception. Can &quot;reach out them&quot;. &quot;people start engaging with these worlds for their own sake&quot; - move beyond utilitarian concerns and art and storytelling come into being. &quot;our present fascination with imaginary worlds has deep roots in human evolution&quot;. &quot;envisages interactions between consciousness and landscape&quot;. Margaret Drabble, A Writer's Britain - how landscape has featured in literature. As we have looked at, how &quot; how textual structures activate embodied cognition.&quot; Talks about “literary cartography” - writers create worlds within and without the text. Ackroyd's narratives - &quot;individuals’ freedoms diminished and handed over to the voracious city. &quot; (cities as well). What Ryan calls 'narrative cartography' - the use of mapped space within literature and storytelling, both conceptually (metatextually) and actually (textually)- plot mappings, geographical mappings, meaning mappings, textual mappings. “We tend to project forms of spatiality onto [the text]”.“We must,” Ackroyd argues, “regard it [London] as a human shape with its own laws of life and growth.” The author must submit to the city’s “monstrous form.” A tension between landscape and character in books, for Weston. Robert Tally Jr. Points out the importance of landscape, ‘setting’, to narrative. The importance of space has been reasserted in recent years. Setting used to be seen as an “empty container”. The “spatial turn” - across cultures. “Spatial literary studies” “Bridging the divide between the word and the world” The “possible worlds” of literary and fictive philosophy. Withers - spatial turn - “place as social practice”. &quot;narrative’s tendency to foreground human protagonists, psychological causality, and human-scale temporality and spatiality&quot; as Schneider (2001) observes, space in narrative usually serves as a background for characters and their actions, and not as a focus of interest. Environment in art - what Robert Tally calls literary cartography. This is a brief history of the growing importance of personal, face-to-faces engagement with SYSTEMIC environment. And goes on to talk about non-fiction, engagement with the rest of the world. &quot;geographical and rhetorical functions of space&quot;. &quot;if the significance of space is a result of its geographic context and the evolving narrative process, then it functions as both a “container and network” of information (16)&quot;. Chronotope Bahktin. The authors develop five layers of space: the domain or spatial frames; how and why characters move and are contained by geography; setting; story space; storyworld, the story spacecompleted by the audience’s imagination; and universal places where social, political, emotional, or cultural boundaries are crossed within a narrative. &quot;s a matter of general configuration rather than of specific geography. Good stories make space legible and meaningful by dividing their world into emotionally and symbolically charged subspaces where different experiences are possible and different kinds of events happen.&quot; - place in narrative. Caraciolo providing a phenomenological account of 'narrative space' in modern times. Space is as important as time in our 'sense-making' of narrative. Tied to grounded and embodied cognition. Spatial frames, setting, story space, storyworld -&gt; moving out in specificity. Caraciolo is distinguished - spae is not just meaningful and reosnant socially and culturally, but personally and phenomenonologically as well. Being present in storyworld geographically, understanding themes through space, being emotionally involved. 'Embodied reactions'. &quot;De Certeau even argued that every story is a travel story, as it has to include spatial practices that localize events (Certeau 1984).&quot; &quot;in recent years a new approach to exploring texts has been developed in not only literary but also media studies which suggests looking behind the authorial narrative to the actual world the “author” creates for the narrative and characters of their stories to live and exist in. &quot;That the worlds invented by “authors” for their narrative are in themselves “dynamic entities” (3) and that these worlds are transformative, transmedial and transauthorial in nature and therefore compelling objects of inquiry which invite speculation and exploration through imaginative means.&quot; , Jenkins' idea of a story as a 'body of information' rather than 'temporal structure'. Lawrence Buell's &quot;environmental imagination&quot;, more often found in non-fiction. &quot;We mean a totality made up of concrete things having material substance, shape, texture and color. Together these things determine an ‘environmental character,’ which is the essence of place. In general, a place is given as such a character or ‘atmosphere.’ A place is therefore a qualitative, ‘total’ phenomenon, which we cannot reduce to any of its properties, such as spatial relationships, without losing its concrete nature out of sight” (1980, 6 and 8).&quot; - it's character. &quot;From the point of view of the ‘actual actual world’ the worlds of fiction are discourse-created non-actual possible worlds, populated by incompletely specified individuals; but to the reader immersed in the text the TAW is imaginatively real, and the characters are ontologically complete human beings.&quot; Now we are into “environmental literary criticism”. Erin James - Econarratology, talking about systemic, environmental concerns. Both concerned with the environment AS IT IS and platonic environments as systems. Has carried over into secularity. - “unchanging individuality” - its ‘perdurance’, perhaps.  &quot; how textual structures activate embodied cognition.&quot; - “Some stories present space as closed and confining (prison narratives; Anne Frank’s diary), others as open and liberating (narratives of exploration; many travel narratives), and still others as open and alienating (stories of wandering aimlessly in a hostile environment). Confined space occasionally turns into a field of endless discoveries, as does Robinson Crusoe’s island. Through its immensity, space may be perceived as separating (narratives of exile; Odyssey), or its existence may be denied by technology (telecommunications; travel through teletransportation). Narrative may also focus on place, a concept commonly opposed to space by geographers, by immersing the reader in a particular landscape or cityscape. And finally, narratives may highlight the importance of our sense of embodiment for the experience of space by featuring a protagonist whose body grows or shrinks out of human proportions. Novels like Gulliver’s Travels or Alice in Wonderland de-automatize our relation to space by showing how movement, navigation, the handling of objects and interpersonal relations are affected by a change of scale. Characters are relating to space all the time, but  new nature writing mirrors the concerns of academic ecocriticism, which has similarly explored how scientific and cultural understandings of nature have created hierarchical distinctions between the human and non-human through metaphors of empirical mastery or romantic rapture, but which also acknowledges that such myths are, in Jonathan Bate’s words, ‘necessary imaginings, exemplary stories which help our species to make sense of its place in the world’. The &quot;emotional-spatial&quot; as a key constituent of ourselves, arising from how our emotional selves interpret the spaces around us.” &quot;During the postwar period, writers grappled with the difficulties that are presented by the very human focus of the novel form. In the same period, creative nonfiction prose concerned with landscape and environment has increasingly deployed a set of literary techniques associated primarily with fiction.&quot; Seamus Heaney - landscape as a “cryptic fabric of signs instinct with spiritual significance.” They are also narratively incomplete. 
The dictionary of imaginary places demonstrates the hold that these places have.
real places upon whcch &quot;authors...installed... their visions.&quot;

Literary geography - From 'landscapes associated with writers' right up to 'how does space work in literature'?
‘at the intersection of agents and situations scattered across time and space’(Hones 2008: 1307, 1302)
‘Spatial frames’ - what we actually see of the environment. Implies the “setting” (the wider environ) and by extension the “storyworld” (a coherent, unified, ontologically full and materially existing geographical entity, even when it is a fictional world that possesses none of these properties) . The narrative includes both ‘spatial frames’ and mentioned elements from setting - the storyworld comes from autocosmics
There must be intrinsic and embedded narratives in all fictional worlds, she says. The story activates the world.Not a &quot;landscaping hobby&quot; - 

Ryan defines four features of worlds: “connected set of objects and individuals; habitable environment; reasonably intelligible totality for external observers; field of activity for its members” (Ryan, 2001, p. 91).

Anthropomorphism/Animism/Animals As Elements Of Environment As Well (In Fiction), i.e. characterising environments: “Popular cultural forms have a strong anthropomorphic bias” - &quot;the scope to representations of animals and shows that trans-species empathy relies on the same cognitive processes as human empathy.&quot; Focus on 'reciprocity' between human and non-human agencies. Non-human and non-animals can have agencies in these models. Nominalization - turning verbs into nouns - processes into agents. the 'nonhuman turn'. rld&quot;. Creating animal autobiographies - a new phenomenon . &quot;strategies for projecting nonhuman experiences in storyworlds&quot; - ranging from 'speaking for' animals (human-centred) to trying to represent their experiences directly. Animals as representatives of their environment. DeMello - become &quot;much more than simply allegorical devices&quot;. Is it fiction or real? Can it ever be real? He asks this question. Works of both 'popular and critical posthumanism&quot;. &quot;anthropocentric ontologies deny proper selfhood to nonhuman beings&quot;. &quot; this other way of configuring creatural life allocates to a whole range of animals possibilities for selfhood that more restrictive ontologies limit to humans—or even to only a subset of the larger human population.&quot; &quot; these narratives may highlight and even challenge our conception of the human&quot; - narratives can be ABOUT place rather than about humans in place. Going back to the intentional stance, updated to suit what we now know about the world. Both think of in human terms and 'defamiliarise&quot; - a 'double dialectic&quot;. Drawing on Blakey Vermeule - the importance of anthropomorphisation and animism. &quot; the conceptual integration of human and non-human traits&quot; empathy and defamiliarisation with landscapes - drawing attention to their otherness, our part in them, our treatment of them. &quot;This rudimentary, proto- typical structure involves the assumption that the entity has mental states and a body (Eder, Jannidis, and Schneider 13).&quot; Janndis' basic character - we can start assuming fairly easily that something non-human can be a character. &quot;stories narrated by non-human animals can destabilize anthropocentric ideologies&quot; - both empathise and other animals. We are p[art of a continuum with them. Can be both familiar and strange, depending on context. &quot; a double dialectic of empathy and defamiliarization (on the one hand), human and non-human experientiality (on the other)&quot;. &quot;Object narrators collapse the cognitively basic distinction between animate and inanimate entities&quot;. &quot; Combined with narrative empathy, defamiliarization can generate narrative interest by producing startling insights: as our case studies have shown, it can expand the audience’s understanding of the physical world (in the Carey text, the object narrators call attention to invisible natural forces and phenomena)&quot;. &quot;challenge anthropocentric worldviews by gesturing towards a dimension of animal experience that is largely unknown to human readers&quot;. David Herman - co-authored acts of narrating in behalf of equally hybrid (or “humanimal”) principals. &quot;solidarity-building projections of other creatures’ ways of being-in-the-wo. &quot;Instead, Goatly’s suggestion is that, in order to dispel this myth, “our image of the world has to become one in which processes predominate and human actors disappear” (1996: 554)&quot;. An environmentally oriented text might be more usefully conceived of as one that moves toward establishing a dialogue between the human narrative, on the one hand, and concern for landscape and environment, on the other, perhaps even only tentatively. Animism today is &quot;the offspring of the early human;s belief systems&quot;. Narratology Beyond The Human - “post-darwinian narratives” - having an animal/human narrative is not simple - can be very complex and “promote dialogue and exchange among the arts, sciences and humanities”. “Trans-species entanglements” “Expanded forms of relationality”. “Our relationship with wild animals should be through imagination and respect, not through exploitation and manipulation and management. Owain Jones - The idea that the 'rural' can be constituted by things other than human agency, 'non-human agency', or 'collective agency' - the 'agency of place'. 'question the prominence of the divide between the natural and the social worlds' - just like old religion. Thus can we think of landscapes, and individuals, as components of systems and systems in and of themselves.  Nature writing, good naturing writing, tries to get away from the bad aspects of anthropomorphism by incoporating the good bits of anthropomorphism - or, rather, panmorphism. &quot;more-than-human geography&quot; - &quot;our ethical relations with 'others' as contingent, sensitive and situated&quot; - The rechampioning of anthropomorphism - “naive and critical modes of anthropomorphism” - we have moved towards the latter. Away from “anthropodenial” (Sober, 2005) “strong and weak anthropomorphism” - is antrhopomorphism unavoidable. Plumwood sees it as better to represent them IN SOME WAY than not represent them at all.  Difficult to locate the ideal path between anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism,. “What storytelling practgices reval about (human attitudes towards) the nonhuman world and its inhabitants” - this is an important part of telling non-human narratives, and may suit games better. HUGGAN sees Macdonald's account as an attempt to both understand wildness and respect its otherness - the goshawk represrnts this. hawk as &quot;silent interlocutor&quot; between her and the wildness of death. Both knowing and not knowing the hawk. &quot;wildness cannot be categorized&quot; Allowing anthropomorphism but not too far.“enchanted, and thereby manifesting a reality beyond exhaustive rational human conceptualization.” &quot;the scope to representations of animals and shows that trans-species empathy relies on the same cognitive processes as human empathy.&quot; - “ the ideal of neighbourly cohabitation that is at the heart of the new nature writing”. H is For Hawk - an animal as a landscape, as an extension of landscape and something to get to know. Uses very algorithmic language, talking about its different features, something she gets to know, uses as a reflection of her own autocosmic relationship with father, a reflexction of her grief. “Domestic animals are beloved, familiar and invisible, while the fascination and remoteness of wild animals is provoked…” “Training a hawk was like psychoanalysis.” Richard Mabey on W.H. Hudson = “saw all birds as extensions of the landscapes in which they moved” - chruches without jackdaws are not chruches. “Stimulus: opera. Response: kill” - like a machine. I am reminded of Henry Moore stating that sheep remind him of living stones.“the workings… of posture and feathers… an exquisitely controlled barometer of mood” Animot - derrida on animals as equals - Who are we following when we follow an animal? We are following ourselves.“An existence that refuses to be conceptualized” - animal as attempted to understand systemically, on an intimate level, rather than merely a player in a story.Animal conception as inextricable from human perspective.“Immense symbolic responsibility” of animals. Like Baker’s ‘Peregrine’ - “remarkable metamorphosis of man into predatory bird”. Away from Hobbesian ‘artificial animal’ and Cartesian machine-animal, to a still systemic but more mysterious animal. H is for Hawk - “so much of what she means is made of people”. “The complexity (and co-constitutive effects) of human-animal interactions and relationships”. Post-human narratology - beyond “normal narratological science”. Helen Macdonald - “my watching… the first few days with a wild new hawk are a delicate, reflexive dance of manners”. Bestiality, and its principle of uncertainty, must be killed in animals. Personality in animals - consistent invdividual traits that differ from other animals of the same species. Or are they “mindless automatons” - “prevailing opinion has swung between the two extremes”. Neither Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Levinas, nor Lacan, he claims, has given such sustained attention to the question of the animal. For Derrida, animals are not different.Baudrillard as well. She feels like a protecting spirit… my little household god” - h is for hawk. Gibson - &quot;re-sacralizing animals&quot; Limitrophy - the gaps and inconsistencies in the assumed binary divide between humans and animals. A mix of domestic geography and ‘wildness’. “Worshipping an iceberg”. “a persuasive reconfiguration of the local”. Beyond “Menzal - animals as “goal-seeking agents that acquire, store, retrieve and internally process information.” Also an unnatural arrangement (according to heideger) - “The original monstrosity of the beast” (baudrillard). Allomorphism - “the wonderous strangeness of animals, which often involves an overtly-sacred language.” “That place where goshawks go when they’ve eaten. It is very far away.” “Split-second ink-starred decisions in the hawk’s tactical computer” “A being whose world is drawn in plots and vecotrs that pull her towards lives’ ends” - “Healthy delight for animal… but with the greatest possible consideration for its biological situation”. In particular, our sentimentality toward animals is a sure sign of the disdain in which we hold them.“All sorts of predatory taxonomies are buried in the baby goshawk’s brain”. Animals &quot;are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts&quot;. &quot;whether he likes it or not, [man] must play the part thrust upon him in accordance with the ceremonial peculiar to that species.&quot; Despot - subordinate relationship. A psychological competition as well as physical when domineering. Whatever it may be, animals have always had, until our era, a divine or sacrificial nobility that all mythologies recount. Even murder by hunting is still a symbolic relation, as opposed to an experimental dissection. Animals don’t always conform to narratives. Helen Macdonald had to impose a human intentionality to wrangle a narrative out of her bird. umwelt close to the idea of embodied cognition &quot; transposing the environment into its subjective meaning, which is accessible only to the encoding subject.&quot; - robot umwelt - the hawk is represented as an experience that we cannot subsume into a system or narrative. Both social and parasocial relationships with animals.” “The idea of using talking animals in the stories (Joe Bear et al.) was Roger’s idea. Clearly, we weren’t going to get very sophisticated or elaborate output from this program, but we could illustrate the basic ideas, and the animals gave it a bit of humor.” Horses in videogames - unerring companions (Roach, Red Dead, Skyrim/Oblivion, Wander in Shadow of the Collosusalways used to name them in the console), silent, tactical, agents in the countryside, probably the closst. You talk to it - a synaesthetic relationship; your button presses both move the horse and cause your character to touch it - people talking about horses being an extension of them (centaurs, chimera character) in games- an extension of you, or of the landscape. Relating to the landscape. Colours complementing, can already jump fences.  &quot; specific entities such as animals and seas are core in people's mental images of nature (e.g., van den Born,Lenders, de Groot, &amp; Huijsman, 2001)&quot; - nicola taylor - &quot;the personality, and thus the personhood of animals, as intersubjectively and reflexively created. &quot; Animals can be persons distinct from their environments, or part of the 'non-human' environment. Drawing sociology into human-animal relations. Beforehand was dismissive, anthopocentric. &quot;the rich traditions of phenomenological and ethnomethodological sociology which see the mind as a social construction rather than a biological given&quot; - &quot; interaction “can be anything that the participants agree to treat as explicit” (Drew and Wootton ibidem: 35-36. Author emphasis added).&quot; (non-verbal, part 4)
&quot;Goffman (1963) specified that interaction takes place when two individuals areco-present with one another: Persons must sense that they are close enough to be perceived in whatever they are doing, including their experiencing of others, and close enough to be perceived in this sense of being perceived. (p. 17) Many interactions between humans and animals meet this criterion. &quot; The construction of personhood as fundamental to social interaction. As a general rule “nonhuman animals are culturally defined as a generic group and, as such, relegated to the social category of “nonpersons” (Sanders 1995: 196). - granting and imputing personhood a big part of human-animal relationships. Animals as &quot;sentient commodity&quot;.  - object/network theory can set animals as components/representational of environment rather than in
 &quot; the other-than-human animals that share our territories&quot;
has historically been denied them, or avoided - new approaches - the 'interactive approach' - approach the animal as a being with a mind in order to discover that mind (quote) - we ascribe personhood through interaction - looking at personhood, mind etc. through observation and lived experience rather than playing language games and making it entirely logical. Our observation of animals, our lived experience with them, leads to ascription of personhood. We approach them AS IF THEY HAVE MINDS - we imaginatvely interact with them from that basis. A basis of personhood based on imagination and engagement rather than fact. (aaltola)
Environmental Personhood - Gwendolyn Gordon - &quot; the nascent notion of designating parts of nature as legal persons entitled to independent regard and consideration.&quot; A legal fiction, but still interesting. In response to the need to protect it. Not a universal thing - as a result of social, political and environmental pressure.
Ohlin acknowledges the term is difficult to define precisely because it draws upon biological, metaphysical, moral, religious, and legal meanings (miqmaq paper).
Personhood &amp; Neuroscience - &quot;Personhood is a foundational concept in ethics&quot; - Difficult to define in terms of psychology or neuroscience - &quot; the product of an evolved brain system that develops innately and projects itself automatically and irrepressibly onto the world whenever triggered by stimulus features such as a human-like face, body, or contingent patterns of behavior&quot; - This is as an ethical term - &quot; Extending the legal concept of a person to some species of animal, for the sake of improving animal welfare, is more than a legal maneuver. It is also the expression of a new ontology, that is, a new understanding of what persons are. Just as slaves were once regarded as non-persons, both legally and more generally in terms of people’s beliefs and behaviors, so too authors such as Steven Wise (2002) suggest that certain animals are now wrongly classified as non-persons.&quot;
Introduction by Graham Harvey (animism) 2 ways - a religious way and a philosophical way - the &quot;spirit&quot; approach and the post-humanist approach. &quot;relational, embodied, eco-activst&quot; rather than &quot;metaphysical&quot; Tylor (histyory of religion, animism as engagement with spirits) - new animism is about communication and ecology - it is about the network, rather than the nodes (his ideas) - &quot;think more carefully about what it means to be a person&quot; - &quot;persons always live in relation to others&quot; - animism can be &quot;quite practical and prgamatic as people negotiate everyday needs&quot; - &quot;ferment of new research&quot; about animism. &quot;the world is a community of living persons, all deserving respect&quot; - Hallowell 1960 (not direct quote) - Hallowell's work with tribes - Talks about adult animism in contemporary socioety - Panpsychism - all matter is sentient in some way. - &quot;cognitive mechanisms arising in the deep evolutionary past but continuing to affect contemporary behaviours&quot; - &quot;continual interrelation of all beings of of matter itself&quot; - &quot;crossing the boundaries between arts, humanities and sciences&quot; -   Animism is still about. &quot;most humans remain enchanted, to some degree, rather than entirely rationalist&quot;

And In Heritage Interpretation? About natural heritage, as well, then? AHI on Natural interpretation. Part of 'bridging the gap' (Shackley 1996) between modern life and nature. Searching for wildlife/clues &quot;a personal journey of self-discovery&quot; The value of interpretation on natural sites in enhancing the visitor experience and potentially reducing visitor impacts has been widely accepted. &quot; ‘Narrative environments’ (TGAC) - Today we interpret landscapes especially -t hey are what are left - they persist, and have a certain character (need a few quotes for this). “rapid escalation in mass tourism globally to heritage sites, museums, historic landscapes and places of architectural interest “. Culloden battlesite. &quot;the authors identify spatial narratives that underpin historic heritage sites, such as sequential narratives, linear arrangements, chronological progression, aerial narratives, and hybrid mixtures of all these types. By identifying these underlying structures, the authors show how signs, roadside markers, memorials, and other displays convey stories and information about these sites in a spatial and temporal manner. &quot; HERITAGE TOO... &quot;Museum exhibitions tell stories, unavoidably political and cultural narratives, which unfold for visitors as narratives within an architectural space. &quot; - Moscardo - &quot;interpretation is about the creation of a sense of place&quot; - &quot;interpretation is embedded in the experience of a place&quot; - &quot;places are socially constructed and linked to group identity&quot; - An autocosmic relationship to landscape, place, locale, space - often non-Western and non-scientific - is important to communicating the significance of place, time, history etc. 
Heritage Landscapes, Kryder-Reid - &quot;heritage landscapes contain both natural and cultural resources&quot; - Very important environments that we relate to in a variety of manners - that we protect, use, revere, &quot;contested uses and values&quot;, political and religious implications, Contested narratives ABOUT these places. Especially when involves disaster or tragedy. A type of landscape that is encountered imaginatively by visitors, is held up in certain ways, certain narratives, that is heavily ritualised and controlled, that we engage with imaginatively.
Champion - &quot;A visitor perceives space as place, and inhabits (modifies the place)&quot;
&quot;The only way then to approach this issue is to view (and design) environments depicting human cultures as hermeneutic (that afford an actively engaged interpretation of the lives and intentions of past inhabitants).&quot;
&quot;The artifacts act like a library of memory cues to remind people how to behave according to certain
events or locations, (Johnson 1997, Crang 1998, Relph 1986). Not just objects but also the wider
environment can act as an artifact. Place is also a collection of symbolic cues for inhabitation, and for
territorial possession, (Rapoport 1982).&quot; - 3.4

NNW - &quot;deploying techniques drawn from novelistic discourse in their treatment of nonfictional material.&quot; About “Human relations with the non-human world” - “we require things to have their own lives if they are to enrich ours” (McF). A use for the ineffable as well as the scientific. Nature writing bridges science and poetry. Aligned with Psychogeography - mapping mind to a space. Psychogeography (Flanagan) - “a discipline… to study and experience the effects of environment… on emotions, thinking processes and behavior” - started by Situationists. The mixing of the occult in Ian Sinclair’s work. Mabey - “all of us who have tried to explore the complex relationships between humans and the natural world”. Mabey points out that it is difficult to homogenize - ranging from literature to science work, “imaginative travel literature” of Robert Macfarlane - but all united by love of and evocation of nature? Grouped as a “kind of cult” - the shamanic tone again? “Most of us prefer to think of ourselves just as writers, who simply wish to embrace a rather larger than usual cast of characters, the other beings and landscapes with which we share the planet – and to respect them as subjects not simply objects. But nature as active subject implies relationships, not simply objective descriptions (that's &quot;natural history writing&quot;), and the difficult work of marrying truth to one's emotional and imaginative responses with truth to an organism's own life.” Confusing whether nature is an enchanted place, whether we know it through facts or metaphysically, or whether it is transcendant. “The overwhelming complexity and depth of a single place”. cog sci in environmental crit - environmental texts exert a deep and effective impact on their readers. Sinclairs, Ackroyds work blends shamanism and moden landscapes - &quot;channel the resonances of place&quot;. &quot;its protagonist is the living mountain itself (the range is taken as a single entity in this respect)&quot;. &quot; The topographical features of place—the “elementals”—make up this environment’s character.&quot; &quot;the “quiescence,” the loosening of self, that is needed for an intimate relationship with this place. She is also clear that she does not “ascribe sentience to the mountain.” Instead, “consciousness interacts with the mountain-forms,” resulting in “matter impregnated with mind.”36&quot; - constructs, LIKE characters. Points out Macfarlane saying that nature writing had a new resurgance from 70s onwards. Away from pastoral romanticism. “Ecologically informed aestheticised observation” “Draw attention to the natural world around us”. “close natural history observation as psychotherapy and psychodrama”. There are issues with it (Oakley et al) - apolitical, elitist, over-romantic. Moran 2014 - personal narratives link to the political and generalised in nature writing. This sense of the obdurate otherness of nature, its mute, unredemptive indifference, is a common trope in the new nature writing. Ecocrit linking to ACTION, using a space - ritual relation to narrative. Descriptions of ritual practices and invitations to perform new ones. “different ways of being alive”. Both action and inaction, travel and ‘stayputtedness’. the complex relation between literary production and environmental activism - taking action within a space. &quot;Smith’s study does important work towards institutionalising New Nature Writing, consistently treating it as a complex, multifarious genre that is intimately connected to socially engaged environmental activism.&quot; Granta 102 - the new nature writing. Also Bloomsbury book on same subject. The “literature of place” - “proliferation of landscape writing in Britain and Ireland” is both stylistically innovative and mindful of ecology and conservation practice - against homogenisation - the “character” of place. “unashamedly anthropocentric” - yes, sometimes... Moran - finding meaning not in the rare and exotic but in our common, unremarkable encounters with the natural world, and in combining both scientific, scholarly observation of nature with carefully crafted, discursive writing. Personal reflection with natural history, cultural history, psychogeography, travel and topographical writing, folklore and prose poetry. all speak to anxieties about human disconnection from natural processes which have grown since the first stirrings of the environmental movement in the early 1970s, Interested in local knowledge, focus on the ‘parochial’ as a positive. Both natural and cultural landscapes. “Finding words to bridge that divide between the otherness of nature”. Ecocriticism - “the study of the relationship between the human and the non-human”. Several different ways to talk about this idea of relational identity and agency, mixing of human and non-human -a secular approach ot older ideas about nature. - &quot;the non-human, the topography, becomes active&quot;. “ Now I warm towards the concept of neighbourliness as a template with which to approach and write about our relations with our fellow organisms. It permits concern, shared circumstance, even love from afar, but demands no reciprocity.”  Not just ‘nature’ writing - basically, those ways that mankind writes about relationships outside of himself - with places, environments, climates, animals. “a recognition of the appropriate, and therefore intelligent, behaviour of matter, and that landscapes have &quot;memories&quot; embedded in their structure that influence their present environs, their future destinies – and the humans that pass through them.” “ &quot;new&quot; nature writing was not new at all, but embedded in a long tradition” - a sentence on its heritage?  a dialogic relationship with places, objects and landscapes: a relationship that is infused with social and cultural characteristics&quot; Palmer, 2014. Combining shamanistic sentiment with solid scientific credentials.  Poole and New Statesman argument seeing it as fashionable solipsism, bordering on religiosity, gatekeeping. “Romantic self-obsession” I disagree, or even celebrate the religiosity. A mixture of secular, phenomenological ideas and spuirituality. From religion to art. “Material, embodied interactions through which the identities of places and human subjects are co-constructed.” Attention leads to understanding, empathy and thus political action in favour of landscape - like with a person? (Jos Smith) - “mind – just as with Leach's ascription of reflective consciousness to animals and plants, or Dee's self-questioning wildebeest and knowledgeable gas – is understood to be spread out everywhere in nature, rather than a possession only of human beings. It's probably always a strong temptation for nature writers to flirt with such panpsychism. Doesn’t matter if it is actually there - we can use it. What Mabey calls ‘the firsthand encounters with nature that are the aboriginal, objective raw material for science and art alike’.[63].  &quot;thoroughgoing embrace of novelistic discourse&quot; for nature writing. The Living Mountain - places being &quot;sinister&quot;, known for drownings, can find wherw water comes from, but just makes more mysteries. &quot;The fully embodied engagement with a specific landscape, the dissolving of one’s being, and the transgression of the boundary between the self and other&quot;. Not studied much even in 2001 (Carter) - both “intimacy and detachment” -&quot; As each element, inanimate and animate, ‘natural’ and ‘cultural’, makes the ‘living’ mountain&quot;.&quot;Rather, she subverts these discourses and provides an alternative to ‘a masculinized ideal of selfhood founded on separation from nature, rational objectivity and a need to dominate’ (Kroeber, 1994, p. 17). &quot;a text which moves beyond habitual means of charting the world and unsettles habitual ways of perceiving a landscape, a kind of domestic geography [2] that maps borders and then transgresses them.&quot; &quot;This would suggest that the narrative arrangement of her work is spatial rather than temporal, and that the individual is not, in fact, central, but exists as a part of a place and as part of a community.&quot; &quot;this is a pallid simulacrum of their reality, which, like every reality that matters to human beings, is a reality of the mind’&quot; - she stands against rational detachment from place, in Carter's view. &quot;Shepherd’s geographical poetics opens up these possibilities for conveying modes of experience that exist beyond the constraints of everyday life&quot; - but also part of everyday life. A definite exploration of &quot;coming to know&quot; a place. Like a person. Refers to mountains as gendered. &quot;coming to be with a friend just to sit with them&quot;. She cannot hope to exploit them on her own; but she can make forays into them. Places unknown because of weather or incline have a sanctity. Talks about interiority of the mountain Mystery of water, unknowablity, life of its own. where come from, where does it go. Animals (like ptarmigan) knowable parts of vast unknowability. Just one character, in parts. Must see enviro as a whole. Never in totality, can never know a person in totality. Points out the revival of writers such as Shepherd by the NNWs. Going to a place is like getting to know a stranger - we have not grown up with them (Jamie’s critique of Macfarlane), unlike Shepherd, who consistently went to the same places. Hitt - Eco/geocriticism are the literary/artistic emergences of our autocosmic relationship with nature Hitt - He sees eco-critical texts as criticising earlier works as divorced from actual real nature, instead residing in ideals and the imagination. He sees that need for word and thing to be close as simplistic &quot;drastically narrow&quot; or &quot;misguided in its assumptions about literary representation&quot;
Mountains Of The Mind - One goes to environments to challenge them, to perform within them. Mountain-climbing as an example; “an epic endeavour: an encounter with the utmost of all foes, Nature” (Macfarlane).
 How we imagine mountains separately from engaging with them.Pitting oneself against a character. “Glaciers open themselves up to you when you look closely at them.”	
 “Invisible attacks of altitude” (character as enviro). Modernity provides a luxury to look at landscapes as something other than utilitarian (p.14). “The space felt vast and malevolently active, as though it were inhaling me; pulling me off into its emptiness.” “When we look at a landscape, we do not see what is there, but largely what we think is ther.” - “What we call a mountain is thus in fact a collaboration of the physical forms of the world with the imagination of humans - a mountain of the mind” - “They do not kill deliberately, nor do they deliberately please: any emotional properties which they possess are vested in them by human imaginations” - “They are also the objects of human perception; they have been imagined into existence down the centuries. - “Not the ways that people have gone into the mountains, but the ways that they have imagined they were going into them” Highly related to Nan Shepherd. “For many nineteenth century mountaineers, then, being among the mountains was little more than a roleplaying game… in which grown men could play at danger” Weber/McF - ‘wonder’ is a state in which we are comfortable with not knowing. Macfarlane states that we invest thoughts and emotions into landscape in Wild Places (smith’s reference). Gods as communicative artefacts. Layton - “ritual as a mode of enacting religious thought”.

Foundation In Science: Lovelock’s Gaia, climate change science. Carraciolo on 'anthropocene' - 'planetary impact of human activities'. Humans are starting to author landscapes even more. Not excursions into nature, but a constant relationship with nature. Biosemiotics - A telos that is internal to nature, not supernaturally (or externally) defined. Qualitative organicism is a position which claims, first, a kind of middle road position, that is, on the one hand, there are no mysterious or non-material vital powers in organisms (non-vitalism), but on the other hand, the characteristic properties of living beings cannot be fully accounted for by physics and chemistry because these properties are nonreducible emergent properties (emergentism) - ‘saving mr. Nature’ - Anthropomorphisation in conservation discourse increases a sense of connectedness and conservation behaviour, Not just animals, but a 'broader, more abstract target' - &quot;, Atran et al. (2002) reported that Itza' Maya, a culture in the Maya Reserve who believe in the existence of “spirits” in the environment, exhibit more ecological practices than do other cultures in the neighboring area&quot;. Mention biosemiotics again. Tilley - Phenomelogical approaches to landscape archaeology. How perception and imaginative engagement with landscape constructs and shapes them - how complex this is, and how complex the landscape is. THe way we encounter landscapes coloured by individual - audience response theory of landscape, here. And a limited viewpoint. &quot;A good phenomenologist is to try to develop an intimacy of contact with the landscape akin to that between lovers&quot; - Nadasdy sees animist beliefs as scientifically valid, and also politically expedient - not just symbolic. &quot;the a priori assumptions&quot; in science and politics about animism are changing. &quot;Euro-American ontological assumptions Povinellio &quot;t the qualitative divides among humans (subject-agents), non-intentional animals (predators-prey), and objects (insentient things)&quot; (1995) - An example of modern rethinking about the utility of ritual. they are starting to have &quot;ontological validity&quot;  THIS STUFF CLOSER TO THE TOP???

Philosophy &amp; Ethics: Tying popularity of worlds to disenchantment (Weber) of the world (Michael Saler's argument). Post-humanism. object- oriented ontology, a perspective that means in the first instance to grant all objects (cameras and flour and humans and spark plugs and computers and sugar) the same plentitude of being. Talking about &quot;units&quot;. (On Latour) - &quot;He gets rid of the human on behalf of perceiving Gaia, the earth’s systems. Object-Network Theory. - and the distributed agencies within them&quot; &quot;He gets rid of the human on behalf of perceiving Gaia, the earth’s systems - &quot;a very reasonable longing to reengage the object world&quot; (Bill Brown). Move away from overly anthropocentric - tied to post-secular - back to originating viewpoints of human relations to other forms of matter. An undermining of dualism. Bogost talks about privileging human perception and being. An alien phenomenology would look at non character-led approaches. The &quot;correlationism&quot; of human-focussed ontologies - leading on from rationalism in the enlightenment. FOcussing on 'units' - a flat ontology. For understanding non-human experiences and positions alien phenomenology tries to show the edges of what the experience of other 'units' must be like. Leading to 'wonder' at the &quot;otherworldliness of the world&quot; (Mullins review). The post-secular. “This process of disenchantment is key to the notion of secularization, and central to the thought of Max Weber, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, John Bossy, Jane Bennett, Charles Taylor, and many others. The enchanted world of the sacred social imaginary was a participatory universe in which all things, and particularly nature, were animate, connected, and potential in ways that could only partially be understood, and only partially controlled.32 By contrast, in the disenchanted world, according to Max Weber’s familiar argument, ‘‘we are not ruled by mysterious or unpredictable forces, but ... on the contrary, we can in principle control everything by means of calculation.’’ Disenchantment - the “iron cage” of rationalist scientific discourse which removes mysticism in modern society - Frederich Scholler and Max Weber. Positive and negative. An introduction to the post-secular. - a mix of sacred and secular approaches to the world around us. The “unacknowledged middle” between nature and humanity. “a moment of participatory porousness” with the world. Not supernatural in nature anymore, but opening oneself to the scientific systems of nature. Does not de-center the self - not human-centered, but not hierarchical or reliant on metaphysical realities beyond nature. Can still be character-based. incomprehensible forces both within it and within ourselves-in-nature, with which we must negotiate. “A post-secular reconceptualisation of our relationship to nature” Confusing whether nature is an enchanted place, whether we know it through facts or metaphysically, or whether it is ntranscendant. Gross (2018) - is nature writing part of the ‘post-secular’, what he calls the “scientific sublime”? In its rhetoic, generates awe at the world around us - comes from literature. A “persuasive resouce” - thrilling our imaginations in a certain way - when we cannot put them into an existing framework, an existing narrative. What Lyon calls the “post-Church head-space”.&quot;a culture that is simultaneously secular and religious.&quot; - like the post-secular. &quot;scientific findings, news reports, and popular films that turn into proclamations of religious faith, people’s mystical experiences with wild animals, and the celebration of new human-animal families, together form a new creation myth.&quot; Talks about actor-network theory - how things can have agencies, be part of large networks of cuase and effect that are emergent - cannot be predicted. Objects and landscapes can be actors in a co-constitutive process. Often about relationality - how landscapes, and people, and processes, are not individuals ina simplistic sense, but are constituted by relations to each other. &quot;the institutions of religion never fully disappear but, rather, are simply temporarily suppressed by the sediment of alternative myths until new social circumstances allow them to re-emerge.&quot; - “post material values&quot; and spirituality. distrust of science, they say! Mixed with Heidegeerian phenomenology. (neal Alexander - a sense of place). Suddaby et al - challenges Weber's view of &quot;progressive rationality and disenchantment&quot; - there is still &quot;magic, mystery and enchantment&quot; - There is lots of &quot;re-enchantment&quot; as well. resurgence of religion and the re-enchantment of science.&quot; - Weber thought disenchantment was the understanding that everything was calculable. &quot; the optimistic persistence of aesthetics, myth and other aspects of human reflexivity&quot; - &quot; there are powerful forces of disenchantment in the world, but there is also a vast but unexamined element of social and organizational life that is simply not amenable to calculation, science or rationality.&quot; Loss of nature-centred world -&gt; human-centred world, for Weber. Cultural critic Akira Mizuta Lippit describes modernity as, ‘the disappearance of wildlife from humanity’s habitat and the reappearance of the same in humanity’s reflections on itself: in philosophy, psychoanalysis, and technological media such as the telephone, film, and radio’ (Lippit 2000 cited Daston and Mitman 2005). Meaning is diseminated (in Derrida’s sense) through a landscape. Produced as a product of the system, not inherent in any one sign; all interacting together. Re. Greg Garrard - “reason becomes the means to achieving total mastery over nature, now conceived as an enormous, soulless mechanism”.  For hampton - New Nature Writing is a post-secular re-centering of our relationship with place - challenges secular, self-centred disenchanted viewed of nature. Mixing art and science. Away from scientific (solely) accounts of nature“A post-secular reconceptualisation of our relationship to nature” -  They are (and will have to be) post-human, because they tend toward what has been described as the ‘flat ontology’ that places human and nonhuman on an increasingly equivalent stand.&quot;
Person in a sense that it is now meant legally:
Reactions to Notre Dame
Gaia - person as place. 
Mother earth/earth mother
Fujiyama - Lord Fuji
Remember Nurit Bird-David talking about the breadth of personhood.
Deeluze and Guattari - recirpocal networks that are unstructured - hierarchies and binaries. Works for both a conception of landscape 
And also natural places/systems - Indian and Kiwi rivers, jungle - a mixture of religious, social, political and scientific imperatives to change the way we interact with entities - and their suitability as chracters.
'Environmental personhood'
Eco and geo-criticism - man vs. nature distinction is &quot;untenable at best&quot;
Posthumanist - Badmington - &quot;radically rethinking thedominant, familiar humanist account of who “we” are as human beings&quot; Away from centralist, humanist accounts.&quot;automatic and unquestionable hegemony&quot;
Ecocriticism and Geocriticism book - A general reference, &quot;space is of the utmost social importance&quot; - &quot;the manner in which spaces and places are perceived, represented and ultimately used&quot; - Talks about alienation from the world - the tension between man and nature - Talking about paul crutzen and the term 'anthropocene;' - the cartesian split leads to nature/man split as well.
On Actor-Network Theory And Landscape - The 'actor', rather than the person - a new way to frame it, doesn't even have to be a person. Remember the difference between 'actor' and 'person'. ANT recognises that allobjects and things exhibit consciousness, and through a consciousness, interact heterogeneously in space; the location of the interaction(s), where they are performed homogeneously, is the landscape. &quot; the nonhuman object exhibits consciousness by being connected to the human actor (or consciousness).&quot; - the network created by consciousness. &quot; objects are connected and networked because they are actors waiting to be activated, but they only become things once meaning is instilled in them&quot;. Away from dialectic (binary) to interconnectedness (network) - &quot;ANT’s paramount significance when studying landscape, allowing the researcher, artist – whoever – to draw upon any entity – theory, object, thing, whatever – in their pursuit for understanding, despite scale, space, place and/or time where they reside&quot; - ANT related to performativity - activities create connections. landscape as a &quot;form or a process&quot; - &quot;ANT suggests that the actor is a number of different things – perhaps human, perhaps nonhuman; maybe conscious, maybe unconscious – and always embodies action (cf. Bruunand Langlais 2003; Butler, 1993). It further suggests that the actor can also be a group of things, and that each thing – as an individual or group – is linked, or networked.&quot; - &quot; is best defined as the definitive ‘stage’ where everyone (and thus, everything) remains involved in production and consumption, whether aware of it or not. &quot;
What Is Posthumanism Cary Wolfe -2010 - Again talking about Foucault's 'The Order Of Things' - Posthumanism traced to cybernetics and system thinking - removing us from any &quot;particularly privileged position&quot; -  For him, humanism involves disembodying the human in order to elevate it. For him, posthumanism was before - it is rooted in an evolutionary, timeless idea of the human, not a new one. Going into Lacan, Zizek - what is real/fake, inside/outside - Deleuze and Guattari's pluralism over dualism. Autocosmic is a pluralist approach. Derrida deconstructing the human/animal divide. &quot;neurophysiological organisation&quot; - beings coming together. The &quot;self-referential formal dynamics of meaning... reduce environmental complexity and interface with the world&quot; Coming out of the the MOVEMENT of systems rather than merely the description of them. &quot;the world is an ongoing, differentiated construction and creation of a shared environment, by... entities that have... their own forms of embodiement&quot; The world and its perception is contingent on the interplay between entity and environment. Maturana and Varela say both open and closed - open at a microscopic level, closed at a top level. Where do we 'close' an environment? Where do we encompass it? &quot;rethink our taken-for-granted modes of human experience&quot; - not closed off, but part of the evolutionary, sensory, semiotic realities of other entities in network.But for such ideals, humanity MUST be considered separately because it has grown up with non-natural technologies, most notably (for Derrida) language. &quot;prosthesis&quot; of the human. &quot;changes how we think about normal human experience and how that experience gets refracted or queried in specific modes and media of artistic and cultural practice&quot; - this is also the role of autocosmics, more specifically - it is more than post-human, though draws on it massively. Narrative is, in a posthumanist sense, the methods by which environmental complexity is processed and reduced 
Posthumanism - Nayar (2014) - An overview on post-humanism - a 'species cosmopolitanism' - 'drawing attention to the constructed nature f the human 'person'' - from non-usual humans through to non-human persons. &quot;taken-for-granted categories of human/non-human&quot; (and person/non-person too) - &quot;a new understanding of 'life' itself&quot; - scientific, social and cultural advances lead us to question the superiority and alterity of humans vs. the rest of the world.
&quot;treat the human itself as an assemblage&quot; (of different influences and co-evolved environments) &quot;CRITICAL posthumanism&quot; not popular (i.e. cyborgs) - &quot;the human as an instantiation of a network of connections... with all forms of life&quot;
&quot;mergers&quot; with other forms -
Contemporary Animism Book - The whole book provuides examples of animism (a particular, characterised engagement with landscape/environment) in the modern age. Including: - Indigenous beliefs - In novels and literature - beliefs in faeries - eco-paganism - Ethics - Darwinian science - Drug use - Economics - Object theory - Environmentalism - Politics - Animals new approaches to anthropology - &quot;the 'who-ness' rather than the 'whatn-ness' of the world&quot;
Tilley and Cameron-Dunn - all the different layers for understanding a landscape. (list them, then use them in 3.4)


Conclusion Of Section
&quot;environmental aesthetics has undergone a recent resurgence after being almost entirely subsumed by the nineteenth- and twentieth-century trend toward seeing art objects as the only proper recipients of aesthetic interest.
Environments as dynamic, reactive agentful objects of interest in and of themselves has a long history, one which has only increased in 20th and 21st centuries. As in fiction, the boundaries between belief and non-belief are porous - our imaginative engagement with fictional, fictionalised and real environments is muddied. CogSci in EcoCrit: Does not need to be real to instigate environmental awareness. &quot;what storytelling practices, in domains ranging from conservationist discourse and instructional literature to avant-garde fiction and life writing, reveal about (human attitudes toward) the nonhuman world and its inhabitants&quot;. “narrative fiction would seem to be peculiarly resistant to the operations of ecocriticism.” (Head), but starting to mix. Part of the “ psychic claims that human beings have made on nature.” schama says we haven’t just rationally exploited landscape in the West, but been as “myth-struck” as anybody else. Price - “nature as myth, nature as resource” - intertwined throughout history. Oscillation between systemic engagement and detached viewing (landscape). Nature Writing as a direct inhabitant of ‘middle ground’ between belief and distance, fiction and fact, characterisation and science, when it comes to environment. Sympathetic beliefs - Hood et al - We still have sympathetic, animist superstitions - their destruction of photograph experiment - rationalism is not enough. Makes point that despite difference of source material, there are great cognitive similarities in how we process textually-evoked worlds and digitally-simulated spaces. The point is that narrative and space are intertwined. Belief/non-belief, fact and fiction get mixed up on the boundarie of environmental fiction and ecocritical literature.
&quot;neuroscience may show us that personhood is illusory, constructed by our brains and projected onto the world.&quot;
Neuroscience may show us that there is no stable concept of persons that applies to the outside world, but instead may show us something in our own heads. THis is not proof that 'landscapes are persons', but does bolster that position.
Westphal - He believes imaginative engagement with real and fictional worlds is fundamental to how we engage with all space
&quot;reconcile the contemporary with a certain protomodernity&quot; - heterogeneity, complexity - the interconnection of all things.

            <Text>Section 3.3: Comp-Art, Environments &amp; ‘Character-As-Environment’

Space As Integral To Computational Programs, &amp; Narrative Comp-Art Specifically

COMPUTATION ITSELF - Manovich pointing out it is inherently spatial, ‘spatial analogy’ of Donald norman.  &quot;computer technology privileges spatial dimensions&quot; - audio-visual-spatial culture. The role of cybernetics -  its amalgamation of themes of communication and control in computational biological, social, and symbolic systems. Not just space, but environment/ecology. A definition of environment? Environment as system. Vance Byrd review &quot;how spatial metaphors help us imagine how information is organized and how we gain access to it through hypertexts, in &quot;windows,&quot; and &quot;cyberspace.&quot;&quot; (Tie it to the prototypical qualities from Chapter 2.  For Ryan, digital media is spatial both in how digital media is constructed, how it creates meaning, hgow it represents itsel.(sometimes only metaphorically). &quot;the intricate relationship between games and ecology&quot;. Narrative in games is like narrative in painting &quot;not sequence but pure configuration&quot; - no. #3. Computer culture gradually spatialises all representations and experiences - manovich. Manovich - world no longer “petrified”, “mobilised virtual gaze” - &quot;machines for generating compelling spaces&quot;. Koenitz in IDN for chnange talking about the history of calling designers 'architects'. &quot;Space has been a central issue for the study of digital media since the introduction of cyberspace&quot;. Calls the ability to act in space in games its &quot;functionality&quot;. &quot;the combination of presentation and functionality” (videogame space book). &quot;Space—virtual or real—has to be encountered and interacted with&quot;. &quot;Through the loophole of virtual space we are able to reclaim the space of the action where we do not “look at” but actively visit the center of the action.&quot; His five types of space in games - rule-based (game system), mediated (what the player experiences), fictional space (imagination), play space (between game and player in real world) and social space (with other humans) - relate to autocosmic interaction with space in life.Need all of them in combination for a game. Talks (17-18) about how games, being simulations on computer, were always about space &quot;Collisions, spatial rela- tions of bodies to each other, audiovisual representations of the environment, interaction with objects in the world and with the world itself—all necessarily highlight the spatial qualities of the game.&quot; He does not conflate all kinds of digial 'space' (for example, hypertext) - he is talking about 3D games. Hypertext is much less complex, spatially, than a 3D environment. Calls game makers &quot;space-makers&quot; - &quot;provides experiences through the structure of the virtual world&quot; &quot;As Wertheim argues: “Despite its lack of physicality, cyberspace is a real place. I am there—whatever this statement may ultimately turn out to mean” (2000, 229; italics in original). &quot; Tied to cybernetic. Systemic and environmental are tied up. WHERE IS THE PLACE - Gives an overview of using 'dimensions for structuing information and interaction'.

HAS VERY MUCH ARISEN IN COMP-ART (AND HERITAGE) - Ryan 2001 ‘habitable environment’, “Simulated, rule-governed worlds.” (Turkle p 78), Montfort talks about it in IF, Gazzard 2011 - games are a spatial medium, &quot;complex and imaginative graphic realms&quot;. What A+C call ‘scenes’. Her ariosto piece determines how space is used in games., P83 - game’s obsession with enviro as inherited from cinema’s movile framing/exploration of space. &quot;This is what the medium of videogames is made for: the exploration of carefully designed environments&quot; - disagree with him that the beings are also good and a part of this... only as props to a landscape. Murray - Digital environments are “procedural, participatory, spatial and encyclopedic.”. Manovich - Movement &quot;as a tool of narration and exploration&quot; - Navigables pace not just an interface but a cultural form in its own right (his words) - &quot;space's symbolic... capital&quot; across human history. Havot &amp; Wesp - “virtual world geographies”, The history of interactive fiction, as a genre, is a history of narratives of confinement and imprisonment. [theHouse] (Mary Flanagan) - example of early use of 3D environment with text to explore &quot;a relationship between two people coming apart ina confined space&quot;. Like Scottish game about abusive relationship - All Roads (Jon Ingold) - another early example of IF being about a space, using space to tell stories, the spatial relationships between characters (in this case, Venice). Curtain - claustrophobia of a space = calustrophibia of a relationship. Chapter #3 - The Great Fire Of London In Minecraft (Museum Of London) - Off The Map (London) (other heritage examples, from Machidon) - Tony Patrickson's That - player's face is the game area (character as environment). La Maison Sensible - installation that rests, that can react to players. Space as character. “Typically, videogames create ‘worlds’, ‘lands’ or ‘environments’ for players to explore, traverse, conquer, and even dynamically manipulate and transform…” (Newman, 2004, p.108). Mapmaking a &quot;constructive process&quot; in digital - not describing, but creating (Worlds and Maps) - cartogenetic - the making of maps of places, rather than the mapping of places.  Epidauros Amphitheatre, Boardshead and Rose Theatre. A game environment does a lot of things. It… 1. Constrains and guides player movement through physical properties and ecology 2. Uses player reference to communicate simulation boundaries and affordance 3. Reinforces and shapes player identity 4. Provides narrative context. Arose out of &quot;the spatial narrative that had played a prominent role in European visual culture for centuries&quot; (paintings, etc.). p. 232 - &quot;for centures, a spatialized narrative in which all images appeared simultaneously dominated.&quot; Therefore narrative does not have to be linear. Laure points out that fiction does this as well - spatial and temporal, cannot detach the two. (I.e. Proust). Spatial vs. temporal art (a distinction made my Lessing (re. Ryan)) is brought together by the simulatory mode in computation. LEssings idea that temporal = narrative is misplaced. ENvironments are highly narrative, and highly autocosmic. Even in IF (When My Boyfriend Came Back From The War). &quot;navigable space... accomplishes the same effects that before were created by literary and cinematic narrative.&quot; - “These players evaluate the realism and the ironic elements of GTA's cities by drawing on their existing knowledge of real American cities and of other media depictions of these places. “ As in chapter 1, we engage with gameworld in many of the same ways that we engage with real world. “the gameworld functions as a meaningful place” (Miller) Calleja’s ‘spatial involvement’. Henry Jenkins - &quot;game designers don't simply tell stories: they design worlds and sculpt spaces.&quot; &quot;The history of videogames reveals an almost linear trajectory of increasingly rich and integrated ecologies of gameworlds.&quot; - &quot;I have compared a playable space that people can enter under the guise of an avatar and transform through their actions with a fictional space, which can only be modified by the creatures of the author and only accessed by the reader's imagination. A complete fusion of game and story should be able to combine both types of experience.&quot; &quot; Another channel Wolf explores is “Interactivation” which is the building and engagement of a world through video, computer, immersive and digital technologies.&quot; Calleja paper - &quot;The spatial structures of games have an important influence on the structure of the narrative.&quot; Nitsche - 2007 - spatiotemproal (both important) in games. &quot;The argument here is that game spaces evoke narratives because the player is making sense of them in order to engage with them. Through a comprehension of signs and interaction with them, the player generates new meaning. The elements that are implemented in the game world to assist in the comprehension will be called “evocative narrative elements,” because they do not contain a story themselves but trigger important parts of the narrative process in the player. These processes can lead to the generation of a form of narrative.&quot; &quot;Game spaces are approached not as foregrounded spectacles based on visual cues such as perspective and parallax but as presented spaces that are assigned an architectural quality. &quot;  &quot;Narrative is seen as a form of understanding of the events a player causes, triggers, and encounters inside a video gam space. From this vantage point, part I reframes key principles of narratology in the context of video game spaces before discussing quests as space-driven content structures for these narrative elements.&quot; &quot; not all games depend or support such a placeness&quot; - &quot;The game world remains spatial but lacks the quality of a place.&quot; He applies architectural theories to game space - the crafting of space to have meaning, defined by its use. Can influence use and use can influence space. Games do this. Space gaining symbolic value in architecture (drawing on Norberg-Schulz) Explicitly makes links to Herman's 'storyworld' concept - our cognitive map of a fictive world and its systemic relations which constantly change, and for which narratives are a prompt to map them. Makes point that space is not generated through reading the discourse, space generates the discourse, in games. Herman focuses on narratives generating space, rather than the other way around. &quot;games became able to deploy concrete worlds to the player&quot; - she sees it as moving to in-world activities from abstract actions that accounts for greater popularity of games. Na Pali - they are &quot;world-forgers&quot;, &quot;something to be navigated and traversed&quot; and &quot;the construction of space that is also a place&quot;. In Na Pali - Game 'environments' are not necessarily the encoded environments - code and assets - but the EXPERIENCED spaces. For her, space = game and place = narrative. “The tensions and unities between space and place lie at the heart of most game narratives.” - &quot;convincing and compelling places to explore&quot;. &quot;In a virtual environment then, the setting should also be aninteractive artifact&quot; - 
&quot;Game environments thus refer generally to the apparent virtual worlds presented by art and programming, and specifically to those worlds’ ecological implications.&quot; 
We have a cybernetic relationship with environments - a closed signal loop - and with virtual environments as well (that is a bridge)


Resonance (Placeness) Of Digital Spaces

Martin, 2011 - “the landscape demands our attention throughout the game. We get to know it intimately whether we stick to the quest, pursue the side-quests or wander aimlessly about.”
&quot;It is up to the designers of the video game space to deliver the evocative narrative elements that support the construction of the story map in such a way that the reading allows for a meaningful interpretation.&quot;
For him -&gt; from cognitive maps comes &quot;story maps&quot; - how we map space in games onto narrative meaning. An interplay of presentation and functionality
To make a digital space a place, we must have a digital identity within it. We must come to have a relationship with it. We must act within it, assign it personal values. Also by allowing for unexpected actions. What unexpected actions are there in combination with my creature? Spaces that are used, interacted with, become place.
Place is resonant space.
&quot;successful gameplay requires that players negotiate environments by discovering their operative logics, games are structurally predisposed toward creating meaningful interaction within artificially intelligent environments and modeling dynamics long at the core of ecological thinking&quot;. &quot;Game environments might also evoke other, more common senses of the word environment—as biological systems (what we mean when we refer, for instance, to the native
habitat of an animal species), and as a human ethical orientation to one’s surroundings (evident in the rhetorical and moral impulses behind efforts to save “the environment”). These valences of environment should not be seen simply as supervening layers added by critical interpretation, but as relationships and orientations embedded in the same visuals and mechanics that determine gameplay.&quot; AS SYSTEM 
 Humans as both part of (engaging in) the environment, but also distinct from it through the necessity of perception of self/other (same in digital environments) - 
&quot;he player’s experience of highly evolved procedural rhetoric, or the playing through of a game’s complex processual argument. Games are filled with both implicitly and
explicitly crafted encounters with algorithmically generated environments, and some of these encounters qualify as sublime ones—combining admiration and fright in ways that can potentially stir players to action, judgment, or reflection beyond the games themselves.&quot;
&quot;players operate within a multitude of environmental parameters that determine not only what the game world looks like, but also how it responds to player input.&quot;
The modern sublime  - &quot;The seductiveness of the Internet might also be explained when we take into account the peculiar unpresentablity of cyberspace.&quot; We don’t need to go to these places and act, but we do. Useufl to the sublime is the distant “possibility of self-destructioN” - virtuality is good for the sublime. You are never too close to danger.
Tied to resonance - &quot; The role of space in technology depends on active reception&quot;
Costikyan on epistemics.
&quot;Virtual space is a product of human knowledge and depends on logic, software, and hardware development... That is why at its core and at the moment of its
creation, it is spatial but not a place....  &quot;In order for these data visualizations to become meaningful, they have to be engaged by the player. Through the active work of the player, through comprehension and interaction, the masses of polygons can transform into places. A genius loci is often defi ned by subjective experience of the location.&quot;
strategic game-space can be mapped onto a mimetic narrative space that represents a world.
Often an &quot;autotelic activity&quot; - part of the joy itself).
The need for a “great world” (Strik).

       Horses in videogames - unerring companions (Roach, Red Dead, Skyrim/Oblivion, Wander in Shadow of the Collosusalways used to name them in the console), silent, tactical, agents in the countryside, probably the closst. You talk to it - a synaesthetic relationship; your button presses both move the horse and cause your character to touch it - people talking about horses being an extension of them (centaurs, chimera character) in games- an extension of you, or of the landscape. Relating to the landscape. Colours complementing, can already jump fences.  
Bogost defines between mathematical and dynamic sublimity - the function of time and movement makes a game environment dynamically sublime. It depends whether you are interacting with the systems as to which sublimity is relevant. 
Rayner (GS) - “I spent so much time playing that game I could have probably worked as a taxi driver there. It was a beautifully realised piece of design”
&quot;Environmental stories invite players to discover and reconstruct a fixed story from the environment itself.&quot;
Not just representation of space, but systemic space.
&quot; the interactive process of virtual navigation mirrors active participation in the real world&quot;
Murray - spatiality part of digital media - not from representation, but interactive navigation - the functionality of space.
The best open-world videogames capture this rhythmic continuity of space. (Keogh) 
Tavinor - discovery/disclosure in games as narrative technique.
“ The landscape is not only something seen and read but also something inhabited and traversed. “ - so can character’s be!
The immersive quality of these games lies as much in the responsiveness of their world as in the pursuit of the game goals.
Playing group talking about landscape as an enactor, as positive - and in my skyrim study -  Skyrim “a beautifully realised world”. Weather, size, variety, cylcical, random events/behaviour - “give it character” - both space and ecosystem. Fish in the shallows that you can pick up and catch. &quot;the core narratives behind many games center around the struggle to explore, map, and master contested spaces (Fuller and Jenkins 1994; Jenkins 1998)&quot;
In Skyrim, exploring, working out how spaces connect, what they mean.
I have tried to find the transitions between different landscapes - it is like travelling through moods in conversation with a person - but it is too pluralistic, and I am too wrapped up in them to notice.Bugs over the water The edges are harder to find.

Not just a picture of a world, but an &quot;entire world-structure&quot; (riles etc.) 
“Game designers routinely theme game spaces… to provide players with a mental attitude well-honed in the real world”
Experience as a system, as an interactor. discovery (as costikyan points out, can be epistemological discovery)
As enactor of narratives - systemic games, open-world games - where the narratives come from. &quot;significant developments in representation of gameworlds.&quot; Well-developed tools and methodologies for creating them. Jenkins Narrative Architecture - when environmental elements are used cohesively, no one has to say anything...the world speaks for itself as the player moves through it. Walking simulators as well - from aesthetic to systemic, the landscape functions as the enactor, the agent, of narrative. Where ‘exploratory’ or ‘ontological’.
Shadows of the Collosus 'living levels'.
Smith and Worch - “what happened here?” - “involving the player in interpreting information”. Landscape becomes not just visual detail but &quot;a process, oscillating between looking-at and moving-through&quot; - landscape as something to use.

Games use the monomyth - spatial storytelling - flawed, but an example of spatial storytelling arising from religion
Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole.‖ (VanOrd, 2011)
Fog of war in games - getting to know the landscape gradually, its caharacter gradually revealed.
&quot;Games teach us how to examine the environment, or space, around us.&quot; &quot;spatial relationships are, of course, critically important to us.&quot;
Exploration is one of our main reasons for playing a game - to know an environment.
Drawing on our embodiement from previous section - &quot;In a game we continually inhabit the present, trying to make sense of ourselves and our positions in space.
Time and space is used as a reward in games - Gazzard 2011.
“ indexical storytelling ”  (Fernández-Vara 2011)&quot; - environmental storytelling
YOU CANNO T AFFECT THE CHARACTER OF LANDSCAPE IN ANY BINARY WAY - only in small ways, picking flowers here and there. They add up. Rather be in a world without people. Totally focussed on the environment, at the expense of myself or my character.
“provide not just elegiac contemplation, but recognition that such processes are still going on”
It has an “ecology” - the systems and interrelated objects within it.
&quot;the viewer can learn relationships between systems” (Ryan)
“Believability”/”plausability” is still important. 
An ecological approach, for Barton, means connecting up the different systems into an ecosphere - could be the same for characters.
“The environment is also a character with which you can interact. You can explore it, learn more about it. It can attack you in the form of creatures, or hypothermia, or long falls. It can change in the picking of plants, the weather, footprints, looted containers.”
&quot;With environmental presence the individual affects and is affected by the outside world. If there is social presence we affect others in a virtual world. If there is cultural presence we should be able to detect a distinctly situated sense of inhabitation, of social values and behaviors preserved and transmitted through ritual, artefact and inscription.&quot;
He thinks it is important to see space not as a static thing, but as something defined by dynamics, systemics, by used and traversal. This is certainly the case with characters as well - characters change.
Massey’s idea that place is not fixed, but a “spatio-temporal event” - just like characters. Cannot have dead environments. Opposed to LiFu Tuan, who says it is fixed.
“A well designed world could tell its story in silence.” [21]

&quot;As the player moves through Dear Esther, he or she must fill the gaps of the “thin” landscape by drawing from reservoirs of emotional, intellectual, and physical experience.&quot;
 &quot;Space creates narrative in all senses&quot; (Zimmerman &amp; Salen). Ryan’s ideas of plot relate to this - uncovering mysteries in environment, and epic narratives are basically ‘travel stories’
Miller-  “layers also develop a strong sense of place in each gameworld—not just navigable space, but place
Carbo-Mascarell points out that walking simulation is not passive. “ games with an immersive use of exploration as a core mechanic utilised for environmental storytelling purposes”,  
Richly interpretable information (Biederman and Vessel in Bateman 2014). 
Miller (2008)  “the exploration of hidden stories embedded in the landscape”.

Martin points out the sublime… the “shudder” .
&quot;That is the crux of walking sims. They are so open to interpretation, so dependent on the attitude of the player as much as the quality of the game on offer. &quot;
&quot;For most players, the depth of the game world is directly tied to the game’s validity as a simulation.&quot;
The goal - &quot;the idea of the game world as a living, dynamic navigable space-in other words, an ecosphere.&quot;

engagement with systems” (2003, 233).&quot;
&quot;a player’s perception of the game world may be refocused to that of an investigator or close observer, via a strict adherence to minimal interactivity and slow, limited pacing&quot;
We are more willing to chunk a landscape in a sympathgetic way than a human.
In FPWs, slow walking speed contributes to contemplation - cannot 'chunk' the landscape so easily. No jumping etc. (Muscat) Also caused by limited opportunities for interaction.
Lack of distance from our connections to online places (p193-194)
Champion (2003) 'memento maps' - not just what is in the space, but ones that relate to personal memories.
&quot;Friedman offers a comparable concept to the story map proposed here: “geography itself is not the protago- nist; rather, the protagonist’s experience of geography structures the narrative”. 
But Friedman’s conclusions that a map in a simulation is “the hero of the story” (ibid.) contradicts the concept of the story map pro posed here. Space contains the triggers for comprehension, but it is not the hero of the story. A story map is the result of a player’s comprehension of the discourse with the video game space. It is not present in the game itself  but evoked by it.&quot;
&quot;Ryan refers to this approach: “If the body in space is the dominant theme of VR narratives, the most important  component of the plot will be the setting, and the narrative structures will be predominantly epic: the user will explore fantastic landscapes, navigate a space fragmented into multiple domains (the rooms of a castle, the diversified geography of an island, even the books of a library), take possession of virtual worlds through movement and action, or achieve intimacy with the environ ment” (2001b, 322).&quot;
&quot;encourages players to consider the virtual environment as something not to be ‘overcome’, but as a subject of interest in itself and enjoyed as a subject of care-free, sustained inquiry and thought.&quot;
&quot;Wolf suggests that all these elements work together to create the “gestalt” of a world which gives it, in varying degrees, a sense of reality and depth.  - systems interlocking. &quot;a sense of wholeness or oneness that allows it to be referred to as a single thing&quot; - a &quot;world&quot; how can we say where the boundaries of a world are - as to where the boundaries of a character is? &quot;video games that can be so elaborate... one can never be sure that one has seen and experienced everything&quot;
Tilley says representations of landscapes are derivative, not directly experienced, not changing systematically in space-time: but computational landscapes are!
Na Pali - A deep dive into a videogame space. About the power and immersivity of this world. The thrill of discovery, or getting to know old worlds better. The nature of the Unreal world as not something to 'claim', or get to know - no map, you cannot conquer it. Mysteries in the distance, cannot access them, always moving forward. The use of 'mystery' and 'opacity' in gameworlds like Unreal's. Links Unreal's environments to the sublime.Mathematical (size) and dynamic (interactive) sublime. &quot;something interesting to do... and somewhere interesting to be&quot;. &quot;slow unveiling of the world&quot; in unreal. The music of the game is part of the environment.  She tries to draw place-led, fictive rationalies for the game-design decisions (guns on pedestals) - gun-worshipping religion?
 Erik Champion - “&quot;Culture has a setting and this setting is enabled through a perceived sense of place. As culture requires a setting, it must be “embedded in real-life situations, in temporally and spatially specific ways.” (Crang 1988, 1). While unique, place is further an “integration of elements of nature and culture…linked to other places by circulation” (Lukermann, referred to in Relph 1986, 3).&quot;
&quot;Finally, a virtual environment has to be writable; a user must be able to leave their mark on it.&quot; &quot;A digital place needs to have narrative fecundity and to be inscribed by multiple perspectives.&quot; &quot;Johnson seems to be arguing that the most engaging three-dimensional environment would be socially associative, interactive, and task-orientated.&quot; &quot;If place as location is a nexus of environmental forces or attributes, we can learn about place in relation to culture by human behavior and perhaps even infer specific mental attitudes by the ways in which humans respond to these environmental forces.&quot;
Eco - a game that is interested in a rich simulation of place. Involves other players, but allied in a relationship with the world. 
A virtual ecology in the extreme.
The Conversation, RDR2 - “virtual ecologies” - &quot;Video games have grown in scale and complexity to the point where intricate virtual ecosystems of this kind are now possible, with flora and fauna living and behaving in these virtual worlds as they do in ours.&quot; - a reductive statement, but still.  open-world games - &quot;dynamic and interactive ecosystems. They have plants that can be foraged and a variety of wildlife that demonstrate complex AI-driven behaviour, interacting with the player and each other.&quot;
Richly simulated systems which can be richly interacted with. &quot;As games increasingly use ecology as a core gameplay feature&quot;
Talks about architecture in the Witness
 ‘place’ makes digital experience more engaging and realistic if place has the following characteristics:
Characteristics of real-world places
·  Recordable-Place gains unique character through the passage of time and use in
relation to the ebb and flow and interaction of dynamic physical and climatic changes
·  Evocative-Place is evocative, it conjures up pictures or images of its previous self or
related activities or past similar places
·  Referential and hybrid: Place is full of references and evocations of related places-we
also populate Place with artifacts from other places.
Desired features of a virtual environment
·  Attenuating environmental forces (for example, wind, fog, rain, directional and
dynamic lighting, sound, perhaps even varying vision acuity).
·  The ability to be affected (modified) so that formal traces of the activity of interactors
etc and of the passing of time remain (including modification by attenuating
environmental forces).
·  Specific details (topography, textures).
·  A way of triggering past associated environments or events that the virtual
environment thinks a visitor has been to.
·  Tasks, events artifacts externs and complex interactors (agents) that are specifically
place-associated, (for example, actors at certain times may be able to move certain
artifacts, but they will only be able to place or leave them in specific places).
 SOME criticism - &quot;Games are predominantly artifactual settings of instant use and destruction&quot;

In Comparison To Dearth Of Characters

REMEMBER - AS MENTIONED IN LAST CHAPTER
In my skyrim study - Towns showed far more subtle understanding of power relations that the people. Characters rote, predetermined.
Machidon on scheduling - good, but still quite LARGE-SCALE. And crowds.
Functioning as NODES.
Rayner (GS) - the characters he interacted with were ‘extras’, cannot remember which ones. “Wasn’t paying too much attention to him”
“The VHs are simply actors playing their part for increased realism.&quot;
Machidon makes it sound that virtual humans are always in subservience to the space being represented - furniture.
&quot;Hence, vitual worlds without virtual human agents and social interaction tend to be perceived by the users as boring and empty environments&quot;.
All resources are spread across the whole system, and as characters are only a small part of that, they only get a little bit of attention.
“Unlike the hero or Martin, the landscape is a compelling, albeit unconventional, character. “
&quot;Left less explored were the other aspects of realistic, physical environments. The inner thoughts and outward behavior of simulated people, for example, beyond the fact of their collision with other objects. The problem becomes increasingly intractable over time. Incremental improvements in visual fidelity make 3-D worlds seem more and more real. But those worlds feel even more incongruous when the people that inhabit them behave like animatronics and the environments work like Potemkin villages.&quot;
The environments reacting BACK to us - us having a relationship with them.
Environments can “orthogonally broadcast” - communicate on many different levels. Nodal characters do not do this
IN sKYRIM - working out where animal’s territories are - the most important relationships I have are with the environment.
The spaces, rather than characters, that are richly computational.
Paul Martin - “The landscape, unlike the secondary characters, is always there.”
Often empty, or focussing around environmental interaction.
&quot;[The landscape] is more real than the people who inhabit it. - quote from Cononor Sherlock for Ossian
 “the island itself is perhaps the most important ghost”
  Me wanting to stay away from towns in Skyrim.
  “No animal life on the island” (Carbo-Mascarell)
No Man’s Sky - about universes, not peoples.
Characters in Gone TO The Rapture - just ghosts - not interactive - a landscape of memories, a palimpsest, that is who you are interacting with.
capturing the subtelty of place, not subtely of person.
Patrick wilson - complexity of behaviour is often down to complex environment rather than complex agent.
Chopped down trees - evidence of human activity - the environment carrying the futile characterisation of the actual agent NPCs.
As Adam Smith says in “The Joy of NPC Schedules”, “GTA’s citizens don’t have individual lives. They spawn to act as props. In those cities, everyone except the characters in the cutscenes is an extra, shipped in to add some local flavour and occasionally fed a few lines of dialogue, but never expected to establish themselves within the narrative or even within the location itself.”
The ease of spatial immersion leads to the heroic, traversive plot having primacy in game narratives. And 'prototypical epistemics'
&quot;blight&quot; of &quot;exposition graffiti&quot; - “&quot;Informational graffiti&quot; in games has become somewhat of a trope now in game design”.
 ---Last Seed, 18th, 4E 201-— The wolf is stupid; it plunges straight into the stream after me. Wolves do not do this. They would freeze to death. But here the wolf-machine has no freezing mechanism, nor has that fear of water been authored. The freezing mechanic is not needed to deliberately and shallowly author believable behaviour. ---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201-— The Radiant AI is easy to interrogate into inadequacy - watching a deer on the shoreline near Riverwood, I started to see the rough edges of its animation, the planar weirdness of its stance, the repetition. I'll try approaching it.
The environment is seen as something fixed, therefore easier to put story into. THis idea that it is EASIER. 
&quot;the appeal of broken worlds&quot; - Points out that gaming tropes &quot;developed... through a process that is valid and important&quot; - it must be engaged with. Must look at why we are obsessed with death, and broken worlds, as a way to allow agency, to overcome technical approaches - When we are not finding the corpses of people, we find the corpses of places” - &quot;In time, this self-perpetuating skew becomes a fetish, a fascination, a paraphilia.&quot;
Bogost - “ the empty ruined world has become too common in games”
Disagree with Crawford on ‘spatial vs social reasoning’.
Such works do not simulate personhood directly, or expose it to the unpredictable interactions of the player; instead, such works present storyworlds in which, for narrative reasons, the characterisation is firmly preterite and pre-executed; scenarios in which the aesthetic is one of loneliness, pathos and introspection. The solitary player-character explores the &quot;emptiness of the environment&quot; (Bogost),  performing he paradigmatic, easily-rendered physical and ludic actions and collecting pre-authored and static narrative components which represent the characters as foregone conclusions, with no need for present execution. Instead, the systemic, interactive procedure is dedicated to spatial exploration and manipulation of these objects, rather than a systemic or interactive procedure centred on those characters in a 'live' sense. I will detail this approach in more detail in Chapter 3, when I relay my own approach to computational character; it is perhaps currently the most popular compromise between the systemics of comp-art and the techniques of traditional art, and has been employed from early videogames such as Myst (Perlin) to more recent 'interactive experiences' such as Dear Esther (Pinchbeck) and The Witness (Blow), and its ready adoption in discourses as disparate as the artgame () and virtual heritage (LaMotta, 2012), belies the abnegation of the potential of computational characterisation that it represents. It is what Calleja calls a &quot;ruins fetish&quot; (2011); a trope which artfully handles the formal issues of character through the employment of &quot;virtual pasts instead of virtual presents&quot; (LaMotta, 2012), but which in its overuse constricts the discourse to a non-computational solution to computational character.
Bogost - “Rockstar’s continued resistenace to moving beyond the stock affordances… [of simulating] the physical world to model inner lives”
NPCs sitting in one place or being destroyed outside of player locale.
Characterization in Absentia - eMILY SHorT - “ruins fetish”
Compare to ‘truth spots’ - Truth-spots - work well (ruins) - “a remnant of the struggle between culture and nature, as the once-built bends to the ravages of wild time”. 
“A character is just a tiny element of any game, and in many cases, it is a superfluous element.&quot; - this is the start of the problem.
&quot;An interactive character is usually a brittle representation, often teetering at the edge of unreality; architecture is much easier than psychology. Games that do make heavy use of interactive NPCs often run into discomfort when those characters are instrumentalized as gameplay tokens.&quot;
&quot;palaces are cheap and kings are expenses&quot;, &quot;architecture substitutes for psychology.&quot;
“But neither the hero nor the secondary characters are ever as eloquent, as dramatic, or as moving as the landscape itself. Indeed, the characters frequently come close to undoing, through a ropey script and stilted delivery, the epic image that the landscape works so hard to establish and sustain.”
Games designers stick to genres that most invested in world-building and spatial storytelling (Jenkins). 
&quot;the emptiness of the environment becomes essential to its operation&quot;.
Lek’s worlds are empty as well. About exploring. - Lawrence Lek uses environments to explore social and political issues - haunting music, no characters.
Meredith points out the issue is that there are no actors in these worlds.You are on your own. The worlds have not been inhabited by “sentient actors” - as with Champion, no culture.
“Characters in this kind of RPG are often highly stylised and clichéd. As Henry Jenkins has suggested of “spatial stories” more generally, characters are “stripped down to the bare bones”, taking a back seat to the description or presentation of elaborate worlds (2004, p. 122). “
Tavinor's idea of &quot;props&quot; leads onto &quot;nodes&quot;.
Martin - “ In fact it is not character, which is often under-written, and dialogue, which is often clunky, which most successfully sustain these themes. Rather, it is space and place.”
”So I suspect that we can gain a sense of cultural presence without experiencing explicit social presence. &quot; 
NPCs as a type of epistemic affordance - anode to get to know the game world - even with complex behaviours. (Tavinor)
&quot;characters are like objects&quot; - nodes within the world - written onto them. But always at a remove. YOu are their god
Dias - Bioshock Infinite &quot;couldn't cope with living spaces at all&quot;
&quot;can create a remarkable sense of place while still being remarkably limited when it comes to defining characters. &quot;
&quot;logic behind day-to-day behaviours of NPCs&quot; - again, nodal, but actually is more a part of the world feeling &quot;alive&quot; than individual characterisation.
RAyner (GS) - Skyrim gameworld - hey're dynamic. Things like the day/night cycle, weather and (possibly) music all seem to change realistically. I think they're probably very complex under the bonnet. I think I'm right in saying that Skyrim is programmed to have events involving characters happening that aren't in anyway scripted - fights between animals, stuff like that. Or maybe I'm thinking of another game...
“All of these games, despite their promise of unknown lands, give no indication of anything intelligent other than players existing in these lands.”
burying puzzle hints in banal NPC convos. That's all that they are there for - to enrich the world and serve as puzzle nodes.

Solution: Character As Environment

Join with ideas (particularly econarratology) from last section. &quot;How can narrative elevate the nonhuman – material objects, but also large-scale processes such as globalization or the weather – to the position of a character?&quot;
People in religion also thought the real world was authored, and everything significant.

Is it possible to generate dramatic entertainment via computers? Drama requires
conflict and engagement, and agents are a quick way to create a sense of challenge
and competition. Are characters enough to create a story? Do they require a highly
sophisticated form of AI? For our purposes, this does not seem to be necessary.
What may be necessary (at least for built heritage) is a developed spatial setting as
a ‘storyspace’. 
Dennett uses a computer as something thaat we can take all 3 stances to
Agents are just systems, like everything.
The Last Guardian - “this creature isn’t like the cute pets that exist in other games, or an ally that’s really useful… an experience that people have never had before.” He is, in fact, like an environment. Benevolent Boss Character
“Is the world something akin to a principal actor, taking center stage, or rather a mechanism for more complex interaction, in and of itself? Is it merely there as a non-interactive vessel for some other form of gameplay?” (Noah Berry)
How does this come out of the autocosmic mindset?
AI as spatial/relational - move beyond mechanical metaphor and tie this to narrative/character construction (we talk about ARCHITECTURES).
Caraciolo - does character HAVE to be human-like? &quot;unsettle the metaphysical primacy of the human&quot;.
The alien and sevastopol are almost one. It is the environment that is the enemy: an almost-animist experience. Ed Smith - Sevastopol is the actual enemy. the alien - &quot;perhaps the mosst remarkable NPC I have ever encountered in a videogame.&quot; - &quot;Movement through space&quot; is youkr best defence&quot;The creature is the environment - needs to be in that environment - it is essentially an animist spirit of the gothic surrounds.
In Silent Hill, environment and creatures are used to reflect the minds of the main characters, complementing the psychological
nature and themes of the game. 
Talks about Calkins character as a psychological maze - different rooms for different moods. Isacc game - dungeon as psyche.
Racter as exploring a space. Even if not a geographic space-  enacts spatial subroutines. &quot;Traditionally, existents are divided into characters and settings based on their significance for the plot&quot; - #3
&quot;Consequently, in computer games the distinction between static settings and dynamic characters transforms into a more complex continuum of combinations, alterations, and middle terms, because the distribution of static and dynamic game elements doesn't have to mimic any practices in other modes of expression and communication.&quot; - the environment can be dynamic as well.
Cheng creating interlapping characterised systems.
His point that games are external, and stories are internal. Do they have to be. (Koster?) - Get rid of this idea of ‘interior’ and ‘exterior’ of a character- just the ‘systems’.
For what it is, Andromeda was brilliant pulpy fun. But it seems to be the latest in a line of recent games that struggle to give meaning to the vastness of their open spaces.

Distributed AI and Multi-Agent Systems
Playing With The Past - Talks about &quot;virtual travel&quot; - passing through and interacting with long-gone spaces.
I am interested in these because they represent something ecosystemic.
Not all DAI and MAS are 'colony architectures' - forming an individual from distinct parts. But certainly DAI is about forming a 'loose entity' - something we can talk about at a macro level. A 'system'.
Multi-Agent Systems is about using multiple simple agents to solve complex problems, agent-based models is about how lots of agents work together, and DAI is really what I am talking about. 
Interesting question - where is the split between agents, and environment? THere is a split WITHIN THE MODEL in MAS, but the environment is BEYOND the system model in DAI.
Similar to actor-network theory - everything can be an agent. A functionally animist view.
Where the individual/entity lies is tied to emergence - where is the 'emergent entity'?
Decentralized individual - remember, MB is not decentralised completely. Not fully or 'embarrassingly' parallel.
Modular, object-oriented: what other words does Bryson draw on for BOD?
So I am applying a narrative, thematic and philosophical overlay to an engineering approach
Manifesting self-organisation
Add 'to-read' for conclusion - colony architectures, individuals as systems, subsumption architeture.
We could say that the character (the environmental character) in a DAI/MAS system is 'the environment' that the agents change and are part of.
A 'bottom-up' approach
&quot; For example, the more ‘inhabited’ or ‘interactive’ environments were not considered more interesting or more ‘Mayan’. This suggests that Cultural Presence is not
synonymous with Social Presence and that cultural learning is too hybrid in nature to be broken down into three distinct modes and tested.&quot;
For 3.4/Conclusion - coherency is HARD.
In opposition to top-down, GOFAI.
I'm interested in distributed, behaviour-led - but behaviours can be internal as well.
Subsumption architecture is really at the heart of it, here - a distributed intelligence model. The heart of 'character-as-environment'. But can't solve intelligence problems, all behaviour-based - char-as-enviro is a philosophical way out of this by reconsidering what a character should be, so that we can continue using and refining behaviour-based models.
Have to be less interested in the engineering side.
SOAR as another DAI approach.
For conclusion - look at other AI models and see how they affect it. It is more cognitive than behavioural.
Soar is modular, but modules include memory, decision-making, 
I've slightly fudged and extended BOD to include soar-like elements, but nowhere near as refined or complex. 
Soar is still about building functional AI rather than strict cognitive modelling.
If we see cognition as a behaviour, happening internally, which we can create competences for, then this would be a good bet - does Bryson want to do this?
MAS is used for COMPONENTS of naturalistic AI (beliefs, desires, intentions, reinforcement learning) - are functional, engineering approaches
&quot;social agency (via scripted agents) needs to be very believable in order to evoke a sense of presence. My interpretation of the findings is that while agents can act as powerful navigation cues, if they are not believable then they are ignored.&quot; - he is still focussing on the environment!
He divides cultural and social - not always the same, cultural is harder to achieve. A cultural understanding of place. Against multiplayer, then! Social presence (being with other people) does not necessarily help us with understanding the culture of the place we are visiting. Cultural presence in place is a form of situated resonance. Here, the social and the cultural come together. (in character-as-environment)
The game that treats body as place/landscape.
Susan Bredlau - the body as place - &quot;loci of intimacy and particularity&quot;
So, BOD/SOAR etc. are using FUNCTIONAL METAPHORS of an individual agent/entity as a series of interrelated modules/objects, interacting systematically to emergently produce higher-level behaviour. Char-as-enviro is an AUTOCOSMIC approach to using these functional metaphors within a philosophical/narrative framework. To look for examples, from other real/fictive disciplines, of personhood working in this way, and applying to how we build BOD-esque agents computationally.

The trad-IF world model is terrific at doors and containers, but few interesting stories are actually about the doors and containers themselves. This is just the easiest proxy we have for the idea of gradual discovery.
Attention on a place like attention on a person.
Place is constructed by human perspective - the role of the autocosmic in landscape. The world as constructed by perspective.

Combining theoretical ideas (interdisciplinary) with practical, methodological concerns. Environmental humanities and related fields as an inspiration - “ this ecology is fatally biased to the modern human individual, and human separated from, and “above” in political and ethical terms, nature. “
&quot;With environmental presence the individual affects and is affected by the outside world. If there is social presence we affect others in a virtual world. If there is cultural presence we should be able to detect a distinctly situated sense of inhabitation, of social values and behaviors preserved and transmitted through ritual, artefact and inscription.&quot; Running these three together.

What gets included under the rubric of character is also up for debate, with philosophers, alongside literary scholars, reflecting on the extent to which nonhuman actors—for example, the lively objects and animated artifacts that populate works of fiction—can be classified as such. 
Increase our idea of personhood.

A character as an environment as an autocosmic approach - instead of trying to build a non-actual person in the traditional sense, take the lessons of enviroment-building (which, as we see above, we are really good at) and apply them to the creation of character - as a place we can get to know, and a person we can explore. As we have seen, we have been interacting with environment as person for millennia. Better-laid foundations, and can use our personalised, characterised reaction to place and environment to build a character-as-environment. Also mix in some of this systemic stuff.
This approach is all about putting the social into the physical/environmental.

Not taking a formalist point of view - not interested in 'character as function' (Propp, in Caraciolo) - as caraciolo states, somewhere between functionalist and mimetic, disregarding the totality of both - an 'econarratology of character'. I don't want to decouple character, remember (Chapter 1), but still interested in 'agencies' (Chapter 2), but still want to stay 'perdurant'.
Broadly speaking, narrative tends to place human characters in the agentive position, while nonhuman realities (including nonhuman animals and natural landscapes or processes) are relegated to the position of objects: tools to further human ends, or a backdrop to human-centered events.

Na Pali is character-as-environment: it is a lone character traversing a world as a metaphor for escape, discovery, wonder.

Applying The Autocosmic Method To A Computational Character

Précis

This chapter charts one particular practice by which the autocosmic method informed the development of Project knole and its characters. By studying human interrelationships with place and environment, rooted in atavistic mental processes and often straddling the demaraction between aesthetic and mundane, social and asocial, the design principles for creating virtual environments are proposed as a metaphorical model for the creation of characters: treating characters as built, systemic environments to be traverse, explored and, in some cases, excavated. The application of this is covered both in relation to the masterbeast simulation and the textual and physical elements which support it.

Section 3.1: The Autocosmic In knole

Start with: I did a lot of normal stuff, as well. Was built as a fairly standard AI bot with distributed systems (see chapter 2) with reactions, drives, sensors etc. A little more about the build and project and what is regular about it. How did I use autocosmic ideas?
Using natural interfaces to trigger bodied cognition.

Martin - “landscape, perhaps one of the most powerful affective devices in fictional worlds”
	The previous chapter showed how a measured, autocosmic approach to computational character could alleviate some of the historical issues of the practice by balancing the construction of systemic, procedural artefacts with the systemic procedures of the audience's mind in reception. Above all, the autocosmic methodology frees the artist to study the processes of reception and imagination in arenas of human life other than the strictly aesthetic. Given comp-art's 'particular' qualities, perhaps this is not only an interesting exercise, but a practical necessity.

	However, the autocosmic is not a prescription: it is, overall, a philosophy and a mood, a 'stance', in Dennett's sense of the word, towards an artist's own creative procedure. It enforces no structures, and counsels no specific technique, but only requires that an interdisciplinary promiscuousness is maintained when considering how one's work will interface with the audience's imagination. For knole, this meant prowling the borders and demesnes of different discourses to seek examples of the processes which underlie the reception of any 'character', in the most general sense of the term: human human beings imaginatively and socially engaging with reciprocal systems in a relationship of meaning-making.

	This wide-ranging enquiry was designed to help me find new paradigms for building my own reciprocal, socialised systems in the form of computational characters, and my resultant influences were predictably numerous. An artist's influences are not always, or ever exhaustively, delineated, and their presence may be barely felt in the final work, despite their importance. knole, both in the practice of creating it and the thematic concerns and fictive details that comprise it, was influenced by many different autocosmic investigations. 

	The 'spyrit', its behaviours, its personality and Anne's relationship to it are heavily based on my studies into the aesthetics, meanings and dynamics of human-animal relationships, from the emotional relationships between witches and their familiars to my own direct observations of family pets and rescued animals, as well as numerous academic studies of how human beings relate to, understand and narrativise their complex relationships with these 'live', lionized and reified characters that abutt their own lives	 The Animal That Therefore I Am 	 David Herman	 Dogs: An uncomplicated relationship	 Wild Animals In Captivity. The construction of the simulation was directly influenced by my studies into how toys function as 'relational artefacts'	 Turkle for children and adults alike, whose engagements with them bear striking resemblance to the narrative, instructive engagements we seek with orthodox fictional characters	 Woodyer	 Turkle	 Mishra	 Gjersoe, defined by less-distinct variables of distance, immersion and parasocial engagement. In particular it was modern, 'microelectronic' toys which concerned the Project most, where systemic 'personalities and responses... [were] real and hard-coded'	 Turkle rather than entirely imaginative, and in which the balance between these two systemic representations has been managed to varying degrees of success	 Watson (Evil Furby)	 Associated Press	 Melissa Batchelor	 Tamagotchi Memorial Page	 Empathy Machines paper (my own). Given the frequent overlaps between robotics and the development of virtual agents, I researched heavily into methodologies of robotics both aesthetic	Forlizzi &amp; DiSalvo	 Braitenberg	 Angliss	 Robots and Art and more utilitarian	 The Hide	 McCarthy	 Riek et al 2009	 The Stem	 Novikova and Watts 	 Fink et al 2012	 Prendinger and Ishikuza 2005	 Wortham	 Jimmy Esbjornsson, including palliative or therapy robots	 Paro	 Geri-Joy	 Robin The Robot, the 'social robotics' of Cynthia Brazeal	 Brazeal and household robots	 Roomba ref #1	 Roomba ref #2	 Roomba ref #3. In each case, I studied how human audiences imaginatively interfaced with the computational systems of the robot, alongside other considerations such as its appearance and the context of the interface, and how characterised, narrative relationships were utilised to improve the particular 'resonant' objectives of the robot: from comforting the elderly to creating a safer workplace.

	Many of my other influences ranged from rather conventional, such as studies of chatbots, imaginary friends and computer-controlled competitive 'bots' in videogames	 Dom article	 ELIZA	 Passing Turing Test	 Zubek and Khoo 	 Partington and Bryson	 Imaginary Friend #1	 Imaginary Friend #2	  Imaginary Friend #3 to the more outlandish, such as the history of automata as characterised mechanical (rather than electronic) systems	 McCorduck	 Public Domain Review to the interesting reversals of characterisation in the literature on dehumanisation and compassion fatigue	 Bride	 Jones Fairnie	 Haque and Waytz, which provided interesting models for Anne's (and potentially the visitor's) treatment of the 'spyrit'. In the spirit of the autocosmic, it was perhaps these less expected explorations of characterisation which were the most valuable to my work. A problem as seemingly intractable as computational character serves to benefit from lateral considerations: and it is one of these unusual approaches which forms the focus of this final chapter of the thesis.
It is perhaps the most important autocosmic inspiration for knole: one which has indelibly coloured its construction, fictive universe and thematic concerns. Above all, it is a specific embodiement of the general autocosmic philosophy; considering how human relationships with space, place and environment can possibly have something to tell us about their relationships with persons.

‘Spatial frames’ - what we actually see of the environment. Implies the “setting” (the wider environ) and by extension the “storyworld” (a coherent, unified, ontologically full and materially existing geographical entity, even when it is a fictional world that possesses none of these properties) . The narrative includes both ‘spatial frames’ and mentioned elements from setting - the storyworld comes from autocosmicsSite-specificity. Controls ‘situation factor’
“people react to game characters in a similar way to the way that they react to real people” (Lanksoki, Gerhard, Moore, and Hobbs (2004)).

Sayre - strong links between non-fictional travel accounts and fictional adventure literature. A transmission back and forth between the two.
Shawn Graham's IF NPC- &quot; Jason Dyer recommended breaking up the Major’s speeches, for, “the sense of discovery in conversation (in this sort of game) needs to be the same as the sense of discovery in exploring an environment.”&quot;
Tilley - THe &quot;scale of analysis&quot; - where are the boundaries of the place we are talking about? 
 “The games that employ animals as characters, it might be said, are employing them in a shallow manner; as leitmotifs rather than as individuals, and with little cognitive depth beyond that which suits that imperative of the limited design.” 
The marks of other visitors.
 &quot;Doggett and Egan argue that during immersive episodes, pretense behaviors can be directly motivated by imagination. In response to these challenges, philosophers typically accept that imagination can have a guidance or stage-setting role in motivating behaviors, but reject that it directly outputs to action-generation system (Van Leeuwen 2009; O’Brien 2005; Funkhouser &amp; Spaulding 2009; Everson 2007; Kind 2011; Currie &amp; Ravenscroft 2002).&quot; 
 the constructed, literary nature of “adventure,” in which non-fictional accounts use techniques—however clumsy or melodramatic they may in some cases be – that bring them close to the fictional creation of adventure, or the adventure novel.
Often invented or borrowed - the nature of ‘non-fictional’ and ‘fictional’ is very gray area! Anne talking about ‘novele’ works.

 “Hidden influences (e.g. internal state) is an obstacle for making fun AI” - therefore make hidden influences uncoverable - like caves beneath a landscape. But cannot ‘vivisect’ a character too much. Creature is an opaque system - patterns are not necessarily divinable, or are divinable in different ways, from how they are laid out explicitly in book - I

 These and other questions make it difficult or impossible to establish a clear line between “fact” and “fiction,” and imply the possibility that in the very writing of non-fiction adventure as adventure it may cross the border, treading on the terrain of the novel by itself becoming fiction.

In conclusion, talk about keith oatley’s two computations in relation to knole and char-as-enviro.

Mention the pressure sensor.
What the ‘temple’ is for.

Tending to the hurts of the industrial revolution now - industrial injuries.

In 3.3: how I used Skyrim.

Need to mention ‘dynamic agency’ more as the defining quality of a computational character. Where is the agency?

How my presence might have contaminated people’s performances.

We also find the equivalent of the ethological approach to animal behaviour in the work of Brooks and others that emphasize the role of essentially fixed behavioural repertoires that are well adapted to the environment (Brooks 1986).
Gilbert White’ s’non-fiction organised in the epistolary style of experimental 18th-century fiction, and daring to pay the same attention and respect to crickets as churchgoers.”

But can't solve intelligence problems, all behaviour-based - char-as-enviro is a philosophical way out of this by reconsidering what a character should be, so that we can continue using and refining behaviour-based models.

&quot;the coming together of the player’s proprioceptive awareness of both the videogame’s material form (controllers, screens, rumble motors, etc.), the audiovisual signs (characters, a projected world, music, menus, etc.), and the various interrelations between all three. To analyse a videogame text is to analyse this entire textual network.&quot; - how character-as-enviro helps this perspective.


TYLOR - &quot;think more carefully about what it means to be a person&quot; - &quot;persons always live in relation to others&quot; 

&quot;as Alan Palmer has observed, it misses its public and open manifestations, as well as its interpersonal dimensions. Narrative is a
form of representation focused on human action, and it is through their actions, much more than through the description of their inner thoughts or emotions, that characters reveal their state of mind.&quot; - works for character-as-environment.

Address the issues of using an animal character? 
&quot;a lot of non-human narratives point to the fact that people may conceive the other (person, animal) as an object in order to cope with reality and to maintain one’s own subjectivity or superiority. &quot;

&quot;By injecting the world and the community with a periodic dose of the sacred, ritual provides the nourishment necessary to maintain cosmic order.&quot;
According to research by Mosaker and others, tourists want to share cultural perceptions and learn through doing, being told,
observing, and asking. In the role of virtual heritage and virtual tourism, people want to feel engaged in the activity, enjoy the
spectacle, feel the pressure of time, (the relative cultural idea of time-place), and understand the ‘embedded’ meaning of local
cultural activity based on artifact.&quot;
&quot;A single, detailed NPC requires as much care in implementation (and as much volume of content) as an entire palace. Emily Short's Galatea, a game in which you have an extended (by video game terms) conversation with a single NPC, was a remarkable achievement in its time and remains impressive today.&quot;
“A constant state of action versus reaction” in an enviro
“Any enclosed space… contains an environment… the total of the container’s surroundings and circumstances”
&quot; our respondents verify that their role-playing implies a form of self-chosen identification with the character.&quot;

'Developments in aesthetic appreciation that extend to ordinary life and activity'. Mention Berleant, and how autocosmics builds on his ideas.
Anne is a foil to the ecofeminist tradition
Ryan on ritual: &quot;the mul tiple ways in which these two fundamental aspects of human culture interact with each other.&quot;

&quot; only by the presence of discrete objects that mimic real-world objects. But under the apparent smoothness of the display lies a highly striated computer representation that divides space into distinct areas and associates these areas with different possibilities of action.&quot; - conc. Crit for comp envrionments.

&quot;the relations between ritual and narrative are sufficiently rich and numerous&quot;
&quot;By extending time spent within the game world the player may gradually ‘soak in’ and indulge in their environmental surroundings and the audio-visual experience.&quot;(205).&quot; - problem for exhibit.

&quot;people engaging with PED put something of themselves on the line—in front of others— when they interact with the technologies we have created. It is that sense of display, or performance, that is the ultimate object of design: the technology is the fulcrum
for exploration.&quot; - for crit in conclusion.
A reference for interactive art installations. (Diana dominguyes
Steve Dixon defines digital performance as “all performance works where computer technologies play a key role rather than a subsidiary one in content, techniques, aesthetics or, delivery forms” [14]

&quot;extreme interdependencies between our brain’s development and our embodied human state. In pointed terms, there would be no mind as we know it without the body that
engenders, contains and nurtures it.&quot;

&quot;radical post-modern thinkers that more or less consciously and critically pursue the task of “abrogating the borderline between historical narratives and fiction” (Iggers 2005: 149)&quot; - autocosmics is not a postmodern weakening of the divides for their own sake, but a critical consideration of the strength and nature of those divides - not divides, but connections.
&quot;Ideally, a virtual world would contain moments where it can either transfix us through its aesthetic qualities, or cause us to question and reflect on our existence and relation to the world. In other words, even if society or culture is absent, the environment itself can have presence. The environmental presence&quot;

SPACE AS INTRINSIC - &quot;More evidence from philosophy shows that even our most basic linguistic/mental concepts are built upon metaphors so deeply integrated into our embodied self that they are taken for granted.&quot;
Getting Gamers - Gone Home more effective because it is in a small area.
&quot;essentialization&quot; in how games represent history - game logic overcomes and chunks the complexity of historiography. Don't entirely agree, landscape has changed now - lots of games that are not nexessarily commercially minded and more nuanced about the past.
His definition of a world - remember, it is different from 'space' - a database is a space. Worldfilledness, worldliness, and worldfulness are the important elements.

&quot; more than static models, these worlds must be simulations&quot; (Champion)

&quot;increasing interest in spatial issues&quot;

Ritual is old ((Shapira 2014))
In some ways I feel that I am merely defining something that other people are already practicing.

large game domain that is buggy and poorly assembled.&quot; (Wexler) - games do big things which are easier, but leave out key points (big, empty cities)
&quot;With environmental presence the individual affects and is affected by the outside world. If there is social presence we affect others in a virtual world. If there is cultural presence we should be able to detect a distinctly situated sense of inhabitation, of social values and behaviors preserved and transmitted through ritual, artefact and inscription.&quot; Running these three together. - we could do this with character-as-enviro. 
&quot;Taste, touch, and smell are far less developed senses, and they do not seem to have any narrative potential&quot;
 Not just scientific approaches, though. How does one manage coherency - can we push the idea of person to its limits? “Is the world something akin to a principal actor, taking center stage, or rather a mechanism for more complex interaction, in and of itself? Is it merely there as a non-interactive vessel for some other form of gameplay?” (Noah Berry). 
. &quot; is the player character's environment an enemy or obstacle that must be overcome? Or must it be exploited to win? Can videogames help encourage players to develop a more responsible attitude towards the world beyond their screens?&quot;

The &quot;overtly other&quot; - perhaps this is the best way to go, rather than trying to pursue human commonality. Falstein talks about animals and robots being easier to do. t’s not human? Really, that’s the real goal - resonant computational characters where the computation goes into ‘human’ traits. I agree that in a way I have dodged the question - though most sensible practitioners do this, trying to compute human-adjacent elements of narratives. Fundamentally - on what level of the universe (as an isomorphism of it) are we trying to encode characterisation?  Could we build environmental characters that are NOT gods or spirits? 

Didn't have time to do everything I wanted.
Games - &quot;Due to their cognitive loading, there is also the issue of time for reflection.&quot; - 3.4, how do I address this?

Adler - 'ruin value' -  &quot;what remains has a specific value regardless of those aspects which have vanished: indeed it is precisely that which endures which imbues the ruin with its quality. This resonates with Auguste Perret’s famous maxim that ‘architecture is what makes beautiful ruins’. &quot; An environmental character from active human society. This is why we have leaned on them so much in the virtual world.

Youngblood et al - “Current game worlds are visually rich but information poor” - look lovely but quite barren.
&quot; Janet Murray - IDN as a “cognitive scaffold for increasing our… understanding of complex systems” - 

&quot;Mixed-reality performances in particular show how experiences that take place in public settings can involve an ambiguous framing that deliberately blurs the boundaries between the fictional and the real [6].&quot; (Conclusion)
&quot;Agro is a star in her own right—a living, breathing companion and partner in crime for Wander, not simply a vehicle for speed or safety.&quot;

Open-world games have become bland, diluted and formulaic - looking to how wandering in a space can be meaningful through nature writing, or guidebooks? Making space meaningful.
Conclusion - 
Animal characters seen as a cop-out. 

CRIT- characters have motivation, but do environments? We ascribe motivation to them.

World as antagonist
Defining autocosmics so completely is not just for this work - laying the foundation for a future methodology towards my work.
“We realise that using animals and other non-human creatures is a very clever trick to make an autonomous character seem more intelligent”.

&quot;Large space can in itself be a constraint on being
able to engage the player: the very properties that
should let you dive in are spread too thin.&quot;
Natural magic left to God what is Gods - therefore safe for magicians - “they aimed at mira, not miracula”.

Designers are desiging &quot;a viewer's experience in time and space&quot;

The same issues of representing space persist - ryan talks about deleuze and gyattari's 'smooth space' rather than 'striated space' - analogue vs. digital.

“the real subject of landscape writing is not landscape, but a restructuring of the human attitude towards nature—and there can be few subjects more urgent or necessary of our attention than this.” - landscape is reader-response to place.
