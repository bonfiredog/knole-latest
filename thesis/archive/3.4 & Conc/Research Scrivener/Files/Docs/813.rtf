It has two zoom levels - at \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91creature -level\u8217\'92 and \u8216\'91landscape level\u8217\'92 - must zoom between them to do Anne\u8217\'92s rituals. Some areas are forbidden (taboo areas) - the fences stop you going down to discover its secret. Hair covering - must cut it to uncover secrets (a mess, Anne refers to trees). Anne referring to birds, god\u8217\'92s finger coming down. Crawling/dragging your way across it. Some things are only visible when you are zoomed in. Taking ingredients from it, like a landscape. The burial place of Sarah and Matthew (mentioned in the ballad). Scars left on the landscape by Anne\u8217\'92s doings-  correlate to the recipes, you can see which were used the most, which were most important to her. Tiny movements versus big movements - both are important. Which \u8216\'91punctualisation\u8217\'92 you are looking at. Bird\u8217\'92s eye view - she wants. Depunctualisation (a network breaking down and all its components becoming visible) - how does this relate to Anne? To how she treats the creature? the reverse - she treats it as components rather than an emergent whole. Bits are more important than as a whole. Hedier and Simmel - slight movements are just as important as big, expressive movements, albeit in a different way. Games are all about the big movements. Apart from in the environment. Perdurance - it carries on without you. \u8220\'93 Metroid Prime makes the player feel he or she is making a concrete impression on the world while also implying that such world will continue to exist whether or not the player\u8217\'92s character is there [13].\u8221\'94 Exploring = getting to know someone. "objects are not digitally simulated as objects-in use, with life histories, with formal or associational traces." - I'm trying to do this."Typically the role of place in virtual environments has been as a locator of objects. Yet cultural geographers argue place is more a constrained and malleable container of localised activities, evoking associations of past events and stimulating future tasks." HOW DOES THIS ALL RELATE TO BEING A PERSON? Players are invested in discovering Dark Souls mysteries because the hints found do not contradict themselves or point to settings not supported by the story. To make it work, attention to detail is essential since the participant will start searching the smallest of the assets for meaning. Susan Bredlau - the body as place - "loci of intimacy and particularity" Intimacy and inhabitance is important here - intimate spaces. It does still react like a person, though. "cognitive overloading (including too many interactive processes for the participant to cope with effectively while immersed within a virtual environment)." - 3.4 again.

Meredith - videogame archaeology - going down into the worlds of videogames, exploring them (the mystery plot) - but also nature writing? Pespective is that of a bird, Anne's only animal - flying above it, untroubled by it. The Enlightenment 'view' of landscape, the importance of detached 'view' as opposed to labouring with the land, being immersed and involved in it - she hates it. Romanticism coming on after that.}

The boundaries between these factors in the total work, the variable \u8220\'93observability\u8221\'94 (Costikyan) and \u8220\'93ambiguity\u8221\'94 (Anthropy and Clark, 2011) of the \u8220\'93game object\u8221\'94 (Aarseth, 2011), are also a productive area of exploration: rather than being a source of capitulation and frustration, an artist can set aside their desire, derived from the field of human-computer interaction, to provide the audience with a gradually complete understanding of the workings of their piece through the interface, and instead use the lack of \u8220\'93direct access to the game\u8217\'92s algorithm under the surface\u8221\'94 (Arsenault and Perron) which defines comp-art (Anthropy and Clark) to explore the role of ambiguity, mystery (Ashwell) and the partiality of understanding that is important to artistic and educational engagement with character-led narrative (Kidd, 2017), thus avoiding the forensic reductiveness that plagues current approaches to computational charactr. Perhaps, as in the (admittedly highly metaleptical) work of artist Maurizo Bolognini (1992), where computers passed randomly-generated images to each other without ever displaying them to the audience on an output device, there is space for characters whose representative systems are entirely \u8216\'91black boxes\u8217\'92, with no clear blueprint available for their construction, and which serve as narrative expressions of the problems of \u8216\'91other minds\u8217\'92 (Wisdom, 1952). The ambiguity and otherness of landscape is permitted. I follow an unnaounced cave in a crevice in a waterfall - you can interrogate the landscape all the way to its edges, iot will make sense. With a determined, designed environment, a game designer can give an environment motivation - to boost our autocosmic assignment of motivation to them anyway - a learned,evolved response. In #3 - the sublime of the unknown game system, of narrative worlds, and our interactions with the sublime natural world (and through nature writing). (Dark Souls and Sublime).}

What happens when you don\u8217\'92t do anything? Keogh points out that "watching, planning, navigating" is play, is interaction, as well. Choosing NOT to act. "Activity and passivity are not opposites in videogame play but fluctuations in the circuit, and thus [\u8230\'85] a new conceptual language is needed to attend to both the operations of nonhuman agency and the human pleasures of lack of agency, of being controlled, of being acted upon. (Giddings & Kennedy, 2008, p. 30)" - finish with - BUT WE DO MAINLY ACT. "The time spent slowly navigating through the game world becomes time for contemplative thought and speculation to the relevance of audio-visual elements. Each new point of focus serves as pieces of additional information that may be added to the player\u8217\'92s mental map. In their totality the player may build a more conclusive or comprehensive picture as to their relationship and significance within the greater narrative context."

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The internet has made finding secrets much easier. Another reason to isolate this game. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t to say that some of the magic and mystery is gone from finding secrets in games, as there is a certain charm in working together on a message board or looking up tips on Youtube. But the dusty relic that is a game manual was an important part of the gaming experience for nearly a decade, and it is a shame to see it fall into obscurity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One of gaming\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s most infamous instruction manuals, the booklet for StarTropics (1990), an action-adventure game for the NES, features one of the most engaging and striking uses of meta in a video game (meta refers to something outside of the actual game). Attached to the game\u8217\'92s manual was a yellowed piece of paper, supposedly resembling parchment, that held a secret code within its fibers that could only be seen when some water was rubbed over the paper. During the quest, protagonist Mike Jones is told to \u8220\'93dip [the] letter in water,\u8221\'94 and players are tasked with figuring out what this means.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The act of playing through the game and figuring out the mystery is quite the experience, and nothing quite like it has ever been done since. Since most players bought the game used, without a manual, the code was constantly published in Nintendo Power, but for those that solved the puzzle firsthand, it remains a great moment in gaming. The Virtual Console release of the game includes the letter in with the digital manual, and at the bottom of the screen is a small pail of water, which is Nintendo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s way of trying to be true to the material.}

This would mean that Mario is actually shattering bricks with human souls when he grabs coins and ingesting people to throw fireballs. The sordid implications were eventually ret-conned, but the original manual stands as a sort of morbid tome to the Mushroom Kingdom\u8217\'92s sordid past.}
