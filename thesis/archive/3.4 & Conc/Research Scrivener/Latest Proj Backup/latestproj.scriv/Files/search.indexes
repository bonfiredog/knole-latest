            <Text>
The Boss Battle

“[An] end-of-level set-piece involving a boss-monster that must be defeated… many times larger and more potent”
Grant Tavinor

“[A] large or challenging enemy… [that] blocks the player’s progress.”
Scott Rogers

The most obvious example of ‘characters-as-environment’ that already exists in games. Their role as environments (or parts of environments) and the strengths that that gives them, is rarely discussed (at least in my reading). Scott Rogers spends twelve seconds talking about the boss’ environment adding “mood and character”, saying things that the boss can’t, but that’s it really.
Often, a balance of autocosmic environment (and all the subsequent benefits described elsewhere in this section) and appropriate, heavily-ludic encounters (for Scott Rogers, a “dance… rhythm [or] pattern”, designed as a test for players.They are often the subject of lengthy post-mortems by game designers (Stout, “boss encounters are a test”, breaking things down into six beats, for example, or Scott Rogers’ checklist (”form must follow function”)
A separate narrative from the game itself; more focussed, and ritualistic. Mike Stout talks about the “boss as a story” that must have good “pacing”
Often, the most memorable characters in games are the “boss characters”.
They have passed from a mechanistic trope into a cultural artefact that can be analysed and critiqued.
Singular characters, defined against others by power, appearance, environment etc. This already helps with the characterisation. Defined against the system of the game (still components or nodes, but much larger, systemic components).
Often considered a tired or long-gone trope, “old-school” (Rogers) (“one of the oldest and most beloved traditions in videogames” (Mike Stout)) but still a large component of many recent games (examples of recent game bosses 2015-2016), as well as surviving spiritually as a type of game experience, even if not as explicit as it once was (examples of this)

Examples

Big Daddies (Bioshock)
Related mechanically and narratively to their wider environment (an elemental creature). 
Must be encountered or approached themselves. 
Part of a system that the player can explore and exploit.

The Xenomorph (Alien: Isolation)
As in every Alien franchise, the alien is an extension of the environment; the shadow, the ducts, the unknown.
The alien is a game-long boss battle, in which it (and you) use the environment to kill or avoid each other.
It disappears and reappears.
Not a node; the main character in the game. The other antagonists are (rarely) other humans, and mostly programmed androids.
Its unpredictability, and use of the environment, is the key.

The Colossi (Shadow Of The Colossus)
Key examples of “character as environment”. They are extensions of the ruined landscape themselves, and must be observed, traversed and understood to be defeated.

Pyramidhead (Silent Hill)
Not necessarily an environment, but an extension of it. (Like an eagle in the highlands, or a goshawk, an elemental creature). Could not exist anywhere else other than Silent Hill.
Theorised that they are part of the protagonist’s psyche, much like the rest of Silent Hill.

The Zelda Bosses (Legend of Zelda)
Ganon’s castle disintegrates; the environment comes down around him.
Gomah (in Ocarina Of Time) is tied parasitically to the Deku Tree as an environment, is rooted in that environment. You must use your traversal as well as your combat skills to defeat them.
Zelda bosses are often about the corruption of an environment by a parasitic, characterised envirionmental force.

Bowser (Super Mario Bros.)
One of the very first examples of a boss.
His environment proves to be his downfall (Bowser’s Castle)
Mario can traverse him/it and defeat him/it.
Approach him gradually in his castle. The environment gives hints of what is to come.

Spider (Limbo)
A creature of the forest, follows the boy.
Made of shadow.
The body is eventually used as a bridge.
Gradually pulling off its legs.

The Bird Of Prey (Shelter)
As much a part of the environment as the badgers. The same colour.
Must traverse the environment intelligently.
The bird has a mastery of its domain.
Reminds me of H Is For Hawk.

The Gods (God of War series)
Enormous bosses that must often be climbed and negotiated to beat.
Chris O’Neill and Bruno Velazquez, their designers, talk about “creating living, breathing levels” in their GDC 2012 talk, referencing Shadows of the Colossus.
They referred to the section as an “experience” rather than a boss battle.

Dark Souls / Bloodborne
Often the environment proves to be part of the boss or part of their defeat (The Bed Of Chaos, Pillars for Ornstein and Smough, the bridge with the Taurus Demon).
The bosses must be negotiated very carefully, both through manoeuvre and equipment.

Kraid/Ridley/Mother Brain (Metroid)
Kraid is found in a “room full of acid”, hurls spikes that must be jumped to be avoided. Takes up multiple screens (in Super Metroid). Tunnels out of the ground. No real narrative alongside it.
Ridley (two platforms of differing height with lava below)
Mother Brain is in her tank, protected by the environment, and destroys the environment after the game finishes.

GladOS (Portal series)
Throughout, GladOS is the facility, is impregnated within it, creates the tests for the player and influences their progress.

Strider/Gunship/Tentacle (Half-Life 1 &amp; 2)
Often within their own environments, owning the environment.
You can use it against them.
The tentacle impregnates the environment, few “safe spaces”. 
Different “weak spots”.
Brennan - “people’s expectations about human/computer interaction are often inherited from what they expect from human/human interaction”.
A system does not need to have a narrative, jsut a homeostasis which moves back and forth.
Relationship To Environments &amp; Autocosmics At Large

One goes to environments to challenge them, to perform within them. Mountain-climbing as an example; “an epic endeavour: an encounter with the utmost of all foes, Nature” (Macfarlane).
You often have to approach the boss; they are static, confident in their realm, or they ARE the realm. This creates a confidence and comfort and sense of rootedness to the character, embedded as a deep system itself rather than as a node, which lesser characters/enemies rarely achieve.
Environmental in the sense of often having weak spots, needed to be traversed, travelled about. You must assess the character as an environment and proceed spatially. They must be negotiated.
By blocking the player’s progress, you are forced to stop and consider that environment/character.
Not just the environment that they are in, but the environment which they are; many bosses have smaller creatures which detach from them and fight or distract the player.
Often, it is treated as incidental/coincidental that the boss is encountered in that specific place; the player’s ingenuity is what helps them figure out how to defeat the boss. However, of course, this is a highly orchestrated, plotted encounter, and the boss could not be defeated anywhere else.
Polygon says “can define a world, give it character and allow players to have a focal point”.

Sam Gentle and Chip - “like alchemy messing with cellular automata”, “patterns stabilising”

Can character be APART from its narrative, or is it only a function of the events? Well, in a book that wiring is solid - but in a game, an environment with potential, a character can DEFINITELY be more apart, while still being a part of the game’s ontology.


We see the human mind as the only one worth emulating - re. Greg Garrard and Cartesian mechanism &amp; bestand
Sauron - not a character, an elemental force. 
To allow humans communication to computers that is as
natural as possible, it is argued that ECAs should be built
upon existing psychological theories about human commu-
nication, emotion, and motivation (Gratch &amp; Marsella,
2004).

To allow humans communication to computers that is as
natural as possible, it is argued that ECAs should be built
upon existing psychological theories about human commu-
nication, emotion, and motivation (Gratch &amp; Marsella,
2004). But what can psychology contribute to build more
believable embodied conversational agents? As Kra ¨mer,
Bente, Eschenburg, and Troitzsch (2009) state, up to now
there has been very little exchange between the virtual
agents community employing psychological theories and
current psychological research. Although there have been
several attempts to implement psychological theories into
autonomous agents, many psychological theories lack the
necessary details needed for a direct implementation. Soft-
ware architects therefore have to do a lot of interpretation,
extrapolation, and ‘‘filling in the gaps.’’ Psychological theo-
ries largely differ in their level of detail, and during the pro-
cess of implementation one soon will find some theories to
be more suitable than others. Consequently, virtual agent
architects sometimes seem to choose their models mainly
based on their computability. For example, the most fre-
quently implemented model of emotion is the OCC model
by Ortony, Clore, and Collins (1988), a theory which is
not the most prominent one in psychological textbooks or
current psychological research (Kra ¨mer, 2008). Further-
more, often specific psychological knowledge about com-
munication and interactional processes is scarce, and it has
been concluded that one has to rely on the intuition of the
designers and animators of ECAs (Cassell et al., 2000) or
on ad hoc models which are based on dubious data or no
data at all (cf. Kra ¨mer, 2008).

Being &quot;lost&quot; in a story.

Let us now move to emotions that occur inside the semi-permeable membrane
of the story world. Such worlds are distinctive, each with its own people, its own
history, its own rules and structure. The worlds inside literary membranes are like
our familiar world, but also unlike it. Murders, betrayals, involuntary passions,
losses, impossible conundrums are much more frequent. In the ordinary world
such events are the stuff of psychiatric breakdowns: yet we enter literary worlds
with expectations, often fulfilled, of beauty and of pleasure

“Microworld” of fiction.
Microworlds - A type of deterministic environment initially proposed by Seymour Papert and Marvin Minsky, in which agents operated within a very delimited realm, their actions appearing realistic in nature and combination because of their context. Papert turned this idea into Microworlds, a dialect of the LISP language, which allowed you to move a turtle in a room by providing instructions.

Non-Deterministic/Stochastic Environment - an agent domain where parts are unknown or unpredictable, though probabilities can be deduced from observation.
Deterministic Environment - an agent domain in which all parts, and their reactions to all actions, can be predicted.
Balkenius says that it must be computed, the model. Therefore environment is a good model as it is an easier system to compute.
With characters, the temptation is to approach things from Minksy's perspective; the metaphor of the 'society' and mind, but I am going for environment and the totality of character. This is a purely physical (in a lot of ways) system, relating to BOD and reactive programming.
A computer's construction is unimportant (p249) - what is more important is its ability to embody a process, a set of rules. Does not have to be very complex, necessarily. &quot;They are made of logic&quot; &quot;multiple processes in interaction&quot; rather than &quot;rigidly serial&quot;
Minsky's 'society' is about interplaying, interrelated processes; could also be called an environment. 
&quot;the question here is at what level we choose to understand things&quot;
She introduces the idea of 'emergence'
 However, as the mind of humans is adopted[sic?] to interact
with other humans, these psychological models and pro-
cesses presumably are best suited for the task.
Also adapted to work with environment.

She critiques the approach of reducing a computer to its smallest processes, because we could do this with anything. 
Therefore this idea of the atomic and the gestalt really applies to environments; environments become a gestalt, from the atomic, through perception.

Honden - kami house - people aren’t allowed in - magic and autocosmics, theatricality. Only opened during festivals.

The environment of a game is often closest to the system itself. 
What Oatley calls means of context - we go through membranes into different scenarios that change the way we conduct relationships - character as context, as environment, which changes our responses to it. “Potentially transformative of the baseline self” (based on Irving Goffman’s work)
Book Group - “the environment almost acts as a character”
Some authors have such a sense of place

Obviously, 'character-as-environment' has a lot of links to paganism both modern and ancient - return to Hutton for Essay #3.

            <Text>(Not as much coverage as I was planning).

If we are looking at environment as a metaphor for creating characters, we cannot avoid wildlife. They are an intrinsic part of environment, revealing it in reflection and helping to shape it as much as human beings. 
They are interested as environmental characters in and of themselves, as well as elements of the wider environment’s “character”. I am reminded of Henry Moore stating that sheep remind him of living stones.
Likewise, we must be interested in a character’s ‘fauna’; the trappings of their existence.

ring of bright water

“No doubt foxes would be regarded as acceptable if they came sweetly, day by day, to lap milk from doorstep saucers… instead… branded as outlaws”
Looking at animals is like reading a book, looking in at unierse, a truth of ourselves.
Richard Mabey on W.H. Hudson = “saw all birds as extensions of the landscapes in which they moved” - chruches without jackdaws are not chruches
“A solitary and ghostly glaucous gull from the Arctic” - animal as character

Nature-watching is a sort of narrative before it is plotted for television. Going and coming back, not in an convenient length, but day after day.


Knole is a reflection of one of the most major losses in my life - namely, pets. I’ve never really lost anybody else.

Re. Macdonald - the hawk, and the ways to unlock its potential (I.e. its flying weight), are like algorithms.

Ring of bright water and h is for hawk - why do we individualise carnivores but not herbivores?
Watching people at London Zoo

Wild, captive, pets

An autocosmic experience

The thrill of not knowing the intelligence that you are chasing
Romantic pastoral - no longer had to fear animals, so wanted to conserve them 

&quot;Thus in giving expression to life man creates a second, poetic world alongside the world of nature&quot; p.4

McF - “we require things to have their own lives if they are to enrich ours”

Faces when an animal interacts with them directly - of being chosen, of being witnessed. What can games learn by going to zoos? Expanding their idea of character beyond the dramatic? Animals don’t always conform to narratives. Helen Macdonald had to impose a human intentionality to wrangle a narrative out of her bird.

Taking home representations of the creatures you are no allowed to touch.
Banging the glass to make them move, interaction expected and required, or at least spectacle - we like things to move.
The gorilla sitting, flexing his bamboo furiously, eyes back and forth, being photographed and recapture
The signs constantly tell us that our assumptions are wrong.
A woman passing - “the lion bit was shit” - what are the parameters of “shit”? Visibility? Reactiveness? A balance between unpredictability and servittude. Like a machine, a cabinet.
Animals named, as characters, their stories. The balance, especially in the Reptile House, of theatricality for humans vs. Actual practicailies for animals. 
Character is different from personhood. The zoo observes characterisation but not personhood. 
Was pleased when tigers were illusive.
I felt guilty the whole time I was there.
As Heideger says, humans and their misunderstandings are the problem. 
All exotic animals - extreme, strnage character types.
Meta-texts of labels and information
“He smiled at me” - no he didn’t.
BUt I’m just as bad - I’m assuming a prisoner’s camaraderies with these animals
By going at all, I’m participating.
Allomorphising them is a different autocosm.
A lemon sole with its kill-me eyes.
Not about the creature, after all; it is religious, about the human witnessing a nature god. 
What does the god do once it is out of its sacral, altaresque environment. 
The herons in the penguin enclosure are not sacralised - they are less characters, we fit them in - but in a garden scene they would be exiotic. 
Animals spend most of their time sleeping - do the animals sleeping, or invisible, become more intriguing?
The empty cages still have an animal in them - nobody walks past them and does not imagine the animal that lived in their.
Witnessing poisonous animals is the ultimate autocosmics - we must imagine the poison, the attack, as none of us have beena ttached before.
The snake is its environment, we remember the dart frog in its green logged home. It is demonstrably a different creature elsewhere.
Who are the big hitters, character-wise, in the zoo, and what unites them.

An exhibit is an intensified sliver of environment. 
The context of aquariums -darkness behidn you, the blue light,. What does an animal alone signify - danger, sadness, specialness, rarrity.

A character is always a tool for knowing and finding.

Celebrity animals, returning for them.

Descartes on animals “they were bodies without minds, effectively machines”

The cats which I have had are all part of one emotional landscape, but never met each other - the previous passed out the door just as the others arrived - like the maquettes in a cuckoo clock.
Mum calls him “a right little character”
Always goes in his corner - dad can’t play with him when he comes home.
Can hear the slightest sound - almost supernaturally.
Evocative objects - “you love your mouse, don’t you?”

Animals come with life stories of their own; they can be responsive but can also be unpredictable.
“Every tiny part of her was boiling with life”
H is For Hawk - “her joy comes from… the unexpected mixed with the expected.”
“That place where goshawks go when they’ve eaten. It is very far away.”
“Split-second ink-starred decisions in the hawk’s tactical computer”
“A being whose world is drawn in plots and vecotrs that pull her towards lives’ ends”
“The compass-beaks of all the small birds hiding in the hedges pointed in fear towards the magnet that we the falcon in the air.”

Environment - woman on the train to Scotland - “that’s slovely, isn’t it”
Macfarlane
“Invisible attacks of altitude” (character as enviro)
Landscapes as character because they don’t change at a human rate - we can return to them.
Mountains in tolkeien
“There was also something about the setting of these stories, the stages on which they took place, which stirred me profoundly.”
Nicknaming glaciers.
Pitting oneself against a character.
Pareidolia is only one way to characterise landscape.
Herzog, quoted in McF - “there was something unusual in the way I saw Lachenal and everything around us. I smiled to myself at the paltroness of our efforts. But all sense of exertion was gone, as though there were no longer any gracity. This diaphanous landscape, this quintessence of purity - these were not the mountains I knew; they were the mountains of my dreams.”
Are landscapes individual characters, or do we come to know them as we approach.
The ultimate autocosmics - the mountain changes character depending how you feel on it.
Nature writing goes from being about people to being just about mountain - or is it.
“The space felt vast and malevolently active, as though it were inhaling me; pulling me off into its emptiness.”
Modernity provides a luxury to look at landscapes as something other than utilitarian (p.14)
Ruskin - “the effect of this strange Matterhorn upon the imagination is indeed so great”
“The imaginative potency of these greater peaks around the turn of the nineteenth century was formidable”
“Venerated forms of landscape”
“Urbanized Western culture increasingly hungry for even second-hand experiences of wildness and wilderness”
The Death Zone - like the Reaper.
“When we look at a landscape, we do not see what is there, but largely what we think is ther.”
“We read landscapes.”
“What we call a mountain is thus in fact a collaboration of the physical forms of the world with the imagination of humans - a mountain of the mind”
“They do not kill deliberately, nor do they deliberately please: any emotional properties which they possess are vested in them by human imaginations”
“They are also the objects of human perception; they have been imagined into existence down the centuries.”
Therefore reading about landscapes (or playing them) is better for characterisation rather than actually visiting them.” -&gt; Virtuality
“Not the ways that people have gone into the mountains, but the ways that they have imagined they were going into them”

Being far-off from a landscape - do we need to understand the systems to appreciate them?
In 18th centry, became “objects worthy of contemplation in their own right.”
He mentions scholar’s rocks - autocosmic contemplation.
Beauty vs. Sublime - both parts of char-as-enviro - “delighted ibn chaos, intensity, cataclysm, great size, irregularity” - both parts of resonance.
Edmund Burke - first sublime writer - “Burke was interested in our psychic response to thing”
Useufl to the sublime is the distant “possibility of self-destructioN” - virtuality is good for the sublime. You are never too close to danger.
“For many nineteenth century mountaineers, then, being among the mountains was little more than a roleplaying game… in which grown men could play at danger”

“At first galnce glaciers appear destitute of life or interest; attractive only for their qualities of desolation and emptiness.”
“Glaciers open themselves up to you when you look clsoely at them.”
“The glacier had a different character for each part of the day
Spindrift in skyrim
God games - character as environment.
“Inhumanity” but not characterlessness.
The relationship between altitude, seeing far, perspective and character - conquering character.
He talks about hundreds of years of culture shaping how we see mountains - same with character, years of enculturation and the bedding down of ideas.
Like the book group - the characters give them jumping-off points for talking about themselves and their lives.
“The unknown is so inflammatory to the imagination because it is an imaginative malleable space: a projection-screen on to which a culture or an individual can throw their fears and aspirations. 
When playing games at launch - we are the same, explorers. 
We can project ourselves onto unknown characters.
Maps “hold the magic of anticipation without the toil and sweat of realistation” (Forbes in Macfarlane) - characters in novels are much the same? Novels are much the same? Same in games? A map to a character - the novel itself, manual etc.
“A continual trafficking of objects” in an environment.
In games, often called the map. The map is the territory.
The mistiness of it in skyrim.
“A map is an abbreviation; this is its definition, its strength and its limitation. 
“To know a landscape properly, you must go to it in person.” Games allow you to do this in an authorially-delimited way.

Both tame and wild animals are elements of environment.
Look at the ANTHROPOCENTRISM of our relationship with the world, through nature writing, religion and elsewise. Can we rejoin nature as animals? I am trying to explore Garrard’s ‘ecological modernism’, in your mutually-beneficial relationship with this creature. This is an animist spirit for the modern age, which does not seek to romanticise, mythologise or sing dirges for a lost past, but which fully engages with the land as it actually is; which sees sweet wrappers as well as moss. This is similar to Timothy Morton’s ideas of ‘dark ecology’ - that all beings are implicated in an environmental catastrophe that has already happened, and the arbitrary distinction between “nature = good, man = bad” is pathetic. Obviously this has large ramifications for my work into character as environment, and also as religion; Garrard points to the oversimplicity of ‘New Age’ nature religions, with a “pantheistic theology” and an idyllic, falsified view of the deep past.

&quot;the idea that an agent in the room must be 'doing the thinking' is just a modern echo of the idea that there must be a soul in the pineal gland.&quot;; To me, then, what matters is not what is happening in the room; it is what the room looks like from the outside. Our reality is internal; and most of our lives are not based on objective 'truths' but on perceptions of situations. Taking this grand 'systems' idea and applying it materially to videogames.

It is not the ecological problem of their survival that is important, but still and always that of their silence.

In a world bent on doing nothing but making one speak, in a world assembled 133 under the hegemony of signs and discourse, their silence weighs more and more heavily on our organization of meaning.

Automata led to the Solipsism and mechanomorphism of Descartes. Did not see that it was his autocosmics that was ascribing life to machine, rather than machinery to life. Indeed, Foucault talked about automata as a way to control and explain nature (Come back to this?)

“He twitches in a short circuiting dream” - h is for hawk


Totemism (one source of life (e.g. the land)) or animism (many sources), both characterise the uncharacterisable.

a whole world usually has a higher potential of experientiality, in particular if it is a narrative world with a high degree of tellability, and this shows that the primary center of illusion in narratives is the story, i.e. characters and events (Hühn → Event and Eventfulness), rather than narration.

I’m lucky to not have lost many people in my life.

manuals can be read in one go, but only really make sense in use with the tool/environment itself - armchair travel vs. real travel.
I have already talked about resonant characters: as possessing many qualities which cause us to bond with them on varying autocosmic levels, from simple recognition of agency to deeper empathetic engagement. 

With computational media, we also need to look at resonance, which is inextricably tied to autocosmics The markers of resonance will be different (or certainly not identical) in games but they will be vital if we are to think about effective and interactive characters in this form. 

My systems in machine - am I trying to 'model' emotions. No, of course not, not in a simulationary way. Nor am I just flippantly making something; I am, by making, saying something about how I think emotions work in an animal, or certainly how I can build a satisfying if simple model which will allow human projection.
This character-as-environment, then, does reach the problem which Turkle identifies; a dissolution of the sense of self. But does it? We create Is and selves using autocosmics; god, environments, etc.
&quot;a computer system as a whole will be significantly, qualitatively different than the sum of its parts&quot; p256

As has also been shown in the Autocosmics section, games are not the best at creating resonant characters. They are, I would say, however, good at creating resonant environments:

Why Are Games Good At Portraying Environments?

A game is a formal system, a simulation of a collection of objects and information moving across several dimensions including time. We can see that this is an easy metaphor for an environment. It stands to reason, then, that games are very adept at simulating environments, and have been since the start, when autocosmics were even more important
Environments are as-easily abstracted and simplified visually for the autocosmic tendency as characters are. Environments need only be very simple, such as the box in Heider &amp; Simmel’s experiment, or the night sky in Asteroids, to excite our hallucinatory and sympathetic drive.
Environments can be very simple in terms of interaction; we do not expect as much of a game environment as we do a game character, and it can be less interactive, and more static or scripted, and still excite our autocosmic response. Examples include the extremely limited but inviting environments of Firewatch (though it drew a lot of ire for being so limited). Indeed, every game environment is extremely limited (certain points of interaction, navigation, nodes in a system) and we do not seem to notice this as much as when a character has only a few blocks of dialogue.     
Unlike resonant characters, an environment is always surrounding, encompassing and ambient; it becomes the naturalised seat of our autocosm, the metaphor for the system, rather than scrutinisable points within it.
Environments suit the format; wide, abstract, dynamic and unpredictable systems. Characters, as parts of this system, do not.
Environment has what Extra Credits in ‘Enriching Lives’ calls viscerality. This is what makes combat good and conversations bad.

Examples (both AAA and Indie, to give an overview)

Planetarium - a piece of software that is a ‘planet generator’; its only point is to generate new worlds. It seems to be for the joy of computation: using floating-point numbers to generate new worlds, and relying on the player’s autocosm to think what might be on them. Indeed, it even uses the name you provide, your own interactive autocosm pulled from your imagination, as the seed for generating something unique. Any life, or characterisation on them, is implied.

Skyrim - A game that was praised for its environmental storytelling, large, unpredictable world full of interactive creatures, immersive scenery, weather, emergent properties etc. but terrible characterisation. The characters were only one part of this overall system, with very little granularity past their individual roles as objects. They did not react believably to things, suffered from frequent bugs, had little granular emotion, shared inappropriate animations. It is a testament to the game’s other strengths that these large flaws are mainly remembered with loving cartoons:

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]

While these systemic problems and large-scale bugs were not confined just to the character system (see examples here: [1] [2] [3] [4]) these are both more forgiven and more easily fixed by game modders - they are minor grievances with the system, rather than systemic problems that cannot be fixed.

Think about cybernetics as a term? A system and control of that sysyrm through technology
La Foret - A game, again, about generating an environment from your choices, in this case a version of ‘La Foret’ by the artist Max Ernst, preserving the original artworks sense of space, depth and autocosmic mystery.

Systematising Nature

PROBLEM: As Greg Garrard says in Ecocriticism, nature is not structured or ordered entire; a Cartesian mechanism allows us to regard animals, and nature, as systems, as machines, as hackable components in a happily-whirring rig. However, I am not sure how I feel about this. Can a creature be reduced like this? Do we have a responsibility not to reduce them? Is the authorship of a system, the ineffables that are not put directly into the code, where a creature’s true expression comes from? Anthropomorphism is a dirty word in modern nature writing, and it is a problem in AI/system structures, as well. Should I care? Should it matter? What are the alternatives? Is anthropomorphism an arrogant thing, or is it a necessary narrative device? Is it just the result of a passive observation; is it always ascriptive? Do animals have NO human or systemic qualities? Do we? Are our systems not built in our image and the image of the world, especially in the case of O-O-O?

Waiting In The Sky - 

Library Of Blabber - A game that realises one of the most outlandish, impressive environments in fiction; Borges’ Library of Babel. Really, this was a mathematical and philosophical exercise, which a game is suited to: the limitations of the simulation (that there is more than you can ever cover, that 99.99999999% of the books are gibberish) are part of the themes and message of the work itself.

Emergence (Stochastics) - In which a few preset rules, when run on a system or environment, can lead to “subtle and complex” (Boden) behaviours.

Places - A series of small, self-contained vignettes, with nothing else to do but wander through them.

Witcher 3 -
Recursion (Looping)

Introduced to me by Patrick Winston, looped or repeated behaviours can very easily give the impression of complex behaviour. This has a ritualistic significance to my narrative, and will be employed extensively.

Seamlessness

Finding ways to avoid awkward non-sequiturs, glitches and seams in the player’s interaction with the world, unlike those that often occur in Telltale Games’ works.
Re. Bryson - “no break or delay in bat’s behaviour”.
Like Ymir - smaller elements all behaving independently produce constantly-novel macro-behaviour.
“Intermediate perceptual results”.
This is related to paracosmic perception, affordances and the human element of design; when we talk about seamlessness in technology, we are so used to the idea that technology is as seamless that if it doesn’t behave like the most natural thing in the world (i.e. the laws of physics on a pinecone crushed in the hand) it irks us as much as if that pinecone did something unexpected.
Object-Oriented Programming - This is a concept on which I have been creatively weaned, and I have no desire to abandon it, not least because it is a central metaphor to BOD; indeed, it is now the “default approach” to programming, especially in AI. Objects concretise notions, and this idea will run throughout my creature; my biological, literalist, imitative approach will be the result of this, a creature as a collection of objects linked by processes, rather than processes alone.Object-oriented is different from ‘procedural’ - older languages.Loyall believes that modularity has its limits, as believable behaviour is tightly integrated and needs to have ionvisible boundaries between modulesRichard Evans - personality of agent must “be composed of atomic components” - traits.

Grand Theft Auto - Most of the game’s NPCs are heavily scripted, in cutscenes. The world of the game is extremely rich and detailed, and the relative autonomy and resonance of its inhabitants, it can be argued, is down to the game’s enormous team and budget. However, despite this time and money the characters still repeat phrases, respond only to a few inputs, are nodes.  As Adam Smith says in “The Joy of NPC Schedules”, “GTA’s citizens don’t have individual lives. They spawn to act as props. In those cities, everyone except the characters in the cutscenes is an extra, shipped in to add some local flavour and occasionally fed a few lines of dialogue, but never expected to establish themselves within the narrative or even within the location itself.”

Else Heart.Break() - Adam Smith talks about this game in his Rock Paper Shotgun article on “The Joy Of NPC Schedules” - how NPCs with schedules show a “clockwork intricacy of virtual worlds”. Smith takes time to enjoy the game, to watch the characters doing things, impressed at their dynamism. “NPC schedules are fundamental to the credibility of a game’s world.”

But scheduled NPCs are still props - he talks about “clockwork intricacy”, “beautiful machine” - that’s what it is, a clever system, they are props, illusions of people; what is intelligent is the environment, the context, not the characters themselves.  

“Liminal” objects in Murray

Grey box architecture - as environment
Garrard and pathetic fallacy

We might sum this up in terms of the problems of game characters. In this, we look to the game developer Chris Crawford, in an interview with don’t die. Crawford has spent 20 years attempting to redefine gaming away from its obsession with traversing space, conquering space and competing in space towards more human, character-driven interactions, what he calls the move from ‘spatial reasoning’ to ‘social reasoning’. He states that ‘spatial reasoning’ is a ‘creative dead-end’, and that we need to move towards creating resonant characters as components within an environment; the traditional approach. 

His main method of doing this is through a game called Siboot, a piece of ‘genuine interactive storytelling’ that I have written about elsewhere, and critiqued. While it is clear that I do not disagree with Crawford as to the problem, I do disagree as to the potential solution. Siboot is not a solution to the problems of character (though I’m not sure anybody ever thought it would be).

My proposition is to treat character as the environment itself, either entirely or as a micro-environment in the larger game environment. This approach allows us to use received wisdom and accumulated practice in spatial storytelling to apply to social storytelling. 

I envision people going away and coming back, over and over, to see how it has changed

Your creature is far too simplistic, you do not have the skills - well, I’m interested in a different sort of artist coming in, with some expertise but not much, and saying ‘instead of relying on technology, can we use basic programming, minimalistic style, on top of intensely authored experience, and rely on resonance, to produce a character’ - heider and simmel, minimal character, hinting in magical texts


Rick Lane on the Escapist talks about sublime and picturesque in a game environment. “Rude kind of magnificence. Rgged and huge as opposed to small and smooth. Different characterisations. How landscape relates to the individual. Has a life of its own, uncaring. Like a character. A landscape is an “image of libery” - but only an image, don’t actually want to go there, cannot find it totally. Same with characters - do we want to deal with them directly, or just think about them.  
Re. Garrard and the sublime - is this part of the paracosmic? ‘Terrible and beautiful’, ‘admired for its vastness and overwhelming power’.

“what could it mean to speak of risk, courage, trust, endurance and overcoming when one speaks of machines?” - Joseph, as always, we are talking about people.


Society Of Mind - An idea put forward by Marvin Minsky, and others, which proposes a model of cognition which functions like a society; individual primitives working collectively to produce an emergent personality, function etc.
Heider and Simmel - the environment (the box) is important - it could be a character as well, it is just as abstract.

Papert’s turtle and microworlds - a deterministic environment that was very expressive. Constraints are good. Winograd’s robot arm.

He prefers analog timepieces as they are spatial.

Norman talks about “exploring” systems.

The feeling of direct control is good - Norman.
“Make the computer system invisible.”
Think of yourself as doing a task, not using a computer.

“Make things visible, including the conceptual model of the system”
“Design should make use of the natural properties of people and of the world.”
Knowledge “explicit in the world”

Direct manipulation interface, haptics, feedback, sound, WIMP environment - desktop as an environment, a turning point for PCs (Laurel talks about this)
Or is it a natural (invisible) interface, interactions coming naturally, do not need to be taught? But they do! The holy manual. Some natural, some metaphorical or learnt. But the whole thing (the entire creature) is a metaphor! 

My approach is different; social as spatial reasoning. My creature is the environment, is the system entire. Through using the dominant paradigm of games (that of the environment), I can enlist the preconceptions and existing competencies of gamers, tools and systems to create character.

This is an example of a kind of conceptual diegesis. There is nothing in the system that is not part of the character or player’s awareness.

Re. Leave No Trace - ritualising civic-minded behaviour. We assume a position of stewardship - we assume the power is in our hands. Let’s undertake the act of ‘not-touching”, of non-individualism.


Mountain in Bogost (151) - “no controls, time moves forward, nature expresses itself).
“What is a mountain exactly? It is a stand-in for the intractability of ever understanding what its like to be a mountain. Mountain offers a videogame version of the philosophical practice that I call alien phenomenology - a sustained, deliberated and challenging space in which to speculate on what it’s like to be a thing.”
“Mountain is no more concerned for you are for facial tissues, or the Indian Ocean is for a lost jetliner.”
What would it be like to be attached to a thing? “Estrangement and confustion, mixed with curiosity and wonder”. This is what I want to do.

Bogost states that gone home would not have received much praise in any other medium 
“The world of videogames is still imbued with indignity, plagued by its own tendency to self-humiliation.”
“Games have often maintained a separation from other forms of human culture and creativity.”
“Encountering games still requires pledging fealty to gamedom.”
“Games have become baubles and gewgaws, pleasant little mdeia creatures sold alongside ebooks and music singles or delivered between profile pictures” - I want to be out of this ubicomp scene. 
He talks about Steam creating a “griminess”, a foreign service, that you have to get through to play interesting things - CONTEXT!
“Diverse games are here to an exent”. 
“Games are still a niche tricked by the echo chamber of internal success into thinking that they are approaching the mainstream.”
“Wavered between affinity with silicon valley and jealousy of hollywood” - look elsewhere for infleucnes! Linked to Travinor’s idea that we must pay homage to the lineage of art before us.

Animals in captivity - you are taking control of a space, fighting with it at first.

Games implicitly build character in by having pespective - not just a camera (unlike films) - it is a characterised perspective. 

Games are a good model of real-world situations, but not intelligence.

Chording

A concept (which is almost certainly well-established under other names) which relies in combining different data streams, variables and other qualities to produce unique results in context. Like a chord is an emergent sound from individual notes, so too can to different variables, images, and otherwise produce something new from their temporal, spatial and informational juxtaposition. It is related to sensor fusion, but is subtly different in that the fusion changes the result.


The environment is part of that character as well. Gothic tradition. The character in a white room would not be the same.
He can’t remember the name of human characters - they are just plot devices - not developed - the AI is the star of the show. 


Norman - make the options in an environment obvious - clicking around in a videogame for what is interactive in an environment. Perhaps then realistic environments are not suited to games, as we cannot make everything purposeful?

In the dynamic between the creature and the acolyte, we see a lot of crossover with the debates about control, ownership and stewardship in ecocriticism. Macfarlane quotes Barry Lopez (p. 211); “if we attend more closely to something we are less like to act selfishly towards it.” This is part of the HCI desire for intimacy and interdependence that I am seeking, though it has a metaphorical power here as well as the functional, emotionally-manipulative one from HCI. 

Characters in books are props, as well!

Make use of information in the environment to complete tasks, rather than relying on internal models - (Donald Norman) - related to BBAI. THEREFORE MAKE THE CREATURE THE ENVIRONMENT.

Not only is the creature an environment, but the acolyte is an agent within that system as well as outside; part of what Howard Sklar has identified as a deictic shift, where a reader is actually placed “within the experience that is being navigated.”

Emptiness or fullness of objects in a game (and of space) -&gt; can use or not use, and this creates the space.

“Wilderness” is a matter of scale -&gt; there is always detail deeper down.
Schneiderman - “continuous representation of object of interest.”

Try to distract them from the technology

“Spatial analogy” (donald norman) is good design. “Controls and displays exploit natural mapping”.
Here is the tension between creating a character to be encountered and a tool to be used.

————————————————

Callois - builds on Huizinga’s ideas, but disputes the role of competition in play - this is important. Why must you be pitted against the system? (Skyrim).

What I am calling autocosmics is a mixture of surrealism and callois’ mix of anthropology and sociology; both the life of the individual mind and its imagination and that imagination in society and ritual.

Interacting with the creature is not, actually, solitary - you can reach out into the world.
Based on reactivity - Balkenius.
There is no reason to assume that an animal
has a better conception of reality than is necessary.
 It is sufficient for the concepts of an animal
to parallel the real world.

We also find the equivalent of
the ethological approach to animal behaviour in the
work of Brooks and others that emphasize the role of
essentially fixed behavioural repertoires that are
well adapted to the environment (Brooks 1986).

It is therefore reassuring to see
that Brooks now acknowledges this need (Brooks and
Stein 1993) (need for memory).

 An attempt to
merge the different theories into a coherent system
would be very welcome.

The first trap is to believe that all learning and
behaviour can be explained with a small set of
principles. The result of this approach has been the
construction of grand theories that set out to explain
all instances of learning but are later revealed as too
limited. It is not unusual for models of this kind to
be both clear and elegant, but this is true only because
their explanatory power has been sacrificed.
The second pitfall is to think that everyone is right
and to simply combine all models one can find into
one big theory of everything. This has often been the
case when AI researcher have felt the need to build
complete systems. The models for perceptual
learning are usually highly incompatible with those
for reasoning and problem solving but this has not
stopped some people from combining them into so
called hybrid systems. While these systems have the
advantage that they combine many mechanisms, all
signs of elegance are usually far gone. Since most
hybrid systems have been directed towards specific
technical applications, their value as theories is also
very limited.

To conclude, I suggest that artificial intelligence
learn the lessons from animal learning theory and
starts to consider complete systems where a large set
of interacting mechanisms are combined in a coherent
manner. The study of such systems will be of great
importance both for the success of artificial
intelligence and for our understanding of learning
and intelligence in animals and ma

We could judge what we are doing along the classical lines of communication - chronemics, haptics, kinesics, vocalics and proxemics.
Time, touch, movement, sound/voice and space.

Chronemic element to my work, definitely - all of these are relevant. 
Biological time, psychological time, social time, cuoltural time.

The time of my characters and perspective - they are “subjective and objective… interdependent and integrated levels of time-experiencing”. Related to autocosmics - we imagine smoothness out of moments?

Chronemics is political as well - how your time is used. This is interesting in a game, where the player’s time is usually sacrosanct.

Are we monochronic or polychronic?

Ecological writing keeps insisting that we are &quot;embedded&quot; in nature. Nature is a surrounding medium that sustains our being. Due to the properties of the rhetoric that evokes the idea of a surrounding medium, ecological writing can never properly establish that this is nature and thus provide a compelling and consistent aesthetic basis for the new worldview that is meant to change society. It is a small operation, like tipping over a domino...Putting something called Nature on a pedestal and admiring it from afar does for the environment what patriarchy does for the figure of Woman. It is a paradoxical act of sadistic admiration.[17]

Triangulation is important in game spaces - the triangulation of the face

Greg Garrard - must let things be, do not define them or attempt to co-opt them. (Heidegger’s bestand) (and how that relates to games!) Poetry is ‘letting things be in language’ - just for the joy of them. (a bit ridiculous I think, Greg)

The world has the message, not the individual. - but it is the world.
Does this change our relationship with character?

The cats etc. As landscapes themselves.

What is the creature’s equivalent of pathfinding?

Laurel - not only creature reacts, but its world - it doesn’t always learn from you - trying to get it to notice you! It doesn’t matter if it misunderstands, misunderstanding is dramatic.

Re. Cronon (from Ecocriticism) - ‘landscape of authenticity - nature cannot be pure unless we are absent

Patrick wilson - complexity of behaviour is often down to complex environment rather than complex agent.

Characters as environment in other forms (I.e. novels)

Related to Rod Brooks’ “Embodied Intelligence” idea…

&quot;marking out of some sacred spot is... the primary characteristic of every sacred act&quot;

&quot;It is 'played out' within certain limits of time and place. It contains its own course and meaning.&quot; p.9

Fighting the idea that computing cannot have a place in the world.

When you are watching an animal, more often than not you are watching its environment as much as the creature - therefore this is a wildlife-watching simulator.

Game AI is inputs and outputs into game environment - but what is the environment? Itself? Not just through actions, but through changing itself.

Re. Greg garrard - “difficulty of narrating ongoing systemic crises within intrinsically individualising forms such as the travelogue and novel” - this approach, then, is better! 

Bryson - prey species are easier to simulate than, “more creative species like predators or primates.”
“The choice between monolithic, ecocidal modernism and reverential awe is a false dichotomy”

Christianity’s ‘dualistic perception” (Garrard) of man and nature THEN apocalyptic rhetoric by the Romantics and modernists - I do not want to do this. 

Keep an eye on a refreshing nature writing -&gt; we need to be more plural, less reactionary

What is your ecocentric moral position as regards the creature as environment - according to Garrard, should be neutral - “even a biocentric ethic is anthropogenic”.

Macfarlane - we inhabit a post-pastoral terrain, full of… compromise”

AI design principle to make the environment as observable, known and deterministic as possible. 



Black &amp; White - environment as character - you are god of the land (though a bit decoupled from it, can move around). Changes according to your choices. Never judges you or tries to force you.

Qualia - what does it feel like to be a god - or was a god only ever a device. 

Everything about it is a metaphor. 

It is lots of different agents - animal wildlife, ‘extra’ in village, buddy character, game director, ‘terrain generator’ - all part of the same character, not the same agent - it is its whole environment. 

Memory of creature as enviro or as creature? Separate strands?

“Environmental approach” - encourage actions of a user in such a way as to form a coherent plot

Weiz - embodied cognition - the body, the context etc. Are important for cognition
A monist approach - body and mind are one. 
P. 71 - Polanyi - “we know more than we can tell” - the creature must seem to do this as well. 
Ontology - the delimited definitions and names of all objects and processes within a dicsipline, as oppoised to their uses elsewhere. A domain symbolism.

Very long and very short fables

Versu is a way of manipulating concurrent activities in an environment while maintaining flow - creature’s face like a dinner party. 

 a world that continues to function even when I’m not looking at it

Society of mind - modular, cellular process w/ emergence -&gt; applied to AI &amp; modern game design.
Sub-routines or co-routines working in parallel.

Weather - how much does it emulate our world and how much its own world? The world of the creature is implied around it.Fairy belief “often tolerated by clergymen on a parish level.”
“Those with a particularly obscure grasp of Christian taching the cosmos would have been peopled by a medly of supernatural figures, of both Christian and pre-Christian origin.
“It is easy to see how some individuals, struggling to survive in  harsh world, could have clung to any supernatural agency which promised to improve their condition, not caring to question its provenance or moral status too deeply.”

“Living with a goshawk is like worshipping an iceberg.”

an artistic, fictive realisation of the “charismatic megafauna” (Garrard)

Like a foliate green man.
Indeed, as I hope to show, a character is a meeting point for the autocosmics of the various different parties (author and audience) and that a character cannot be removed for examination from this subjective arena (a development of reader-response theory).

H is for Hawk as a model for the creature’s interaction.
The abuse inherent in her relationship “implications of taking something’s sight away to calm it.”
“What’s salient to the hawk in the city is not what is salient to man” - uexkull, what does the creature care about? Different from what we care about. 
“All sorts of predatory taxonomies are buried in the baby goshawk’s brain”
“To anybody who has spent two months training a goshawk… it seems very extraordinary that the complex psychology of a human being cna be taught with a stick” - that’s because the hawk reduces us to a stick. That is all they see us as. They mechanise us! A barrier between us “real, contradictory, self-willed beings”.

How far can I push this as a model?

In keeping with theories on character-as-environment and diegesis, I think it is important to keep all elements of the creature (both visually and mechanically) biologically metaphorical. Constraints should be invisible, or obfuscated. I shouldn’t hide the functionality, just make it biological.

Daimons were not always represented in art.
‘The whole air is full of souls. We call them daemones and heros, and it is they who send dreams, signs and illnesses to men; and not only men, but also to sheep and other domestic animals.

Autocosmics relies on black boxes, on a form of operational mysticism. A black box can only be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs. Inferring the inside. As opposed to a white box.
Character’s inputs and outputs? Do not know what is going on inside? Our character changes from black box to white box as you wound its flesh. And you read the text. She reveals all of its secrets.
“Only the behaviour of the system will be accounted for”
Not all characters are black boxes though, however. We can have access to their deepest thoughts. Therefore, how does autocosmics fit into black boxes? Do you need a black box to autocosmise? No, of course not. It may work against autocosmics. But, of course, perhaps it heightens it. A character in a novel that we relate to more (this is a form of interest in character, but not the only one) or a cat that we must infer?
Every black box must have an observer - as every character must have an audience?
But can also be an experiment - influence the input.
A character in a game MUST be a bit of a black box, at least to start with?

Even when we reveal the innermost thoughts of a character, we are not whitening the box; we are just providing more obfuscated information. It does not explain everything. We cannot reveal the inner workings of a character in a game or computation - that is separate, it is like drawing attention to grammar.In most stories, do not want to do that.

Black box theory of consciousness - we can only understand the mind in terms of inputs and outputs - that is what we are interested in here. Behaviourism attached to this.

A black box theory - the relationship between inner and outer qualities.
Characters are black boxes as outputs and inputs (resonance) are only tangentially related to their actual interiors - words etc.

How much internal state and modelling do we need? Do we follow drama princess/laurel/game AI method and say “output and appearance is everything?” Does it always require an audience? No, environment has deep systems which we chunk and try to understand.

Critique of Weiz - things must be reducible if we are to represent them - fictional characters are reductions. The real rehydration of character occurs in the mind. 
“There must be waiting time built in as a fulfilling experience with the natural world, involves more than passively sitting back to be informed and entertained.”

The creature’s animality is a creative constraint, not a bow-out of the AI debate entirely.

10. Which Creatures Undergo States with Qualia?
Do frogs have qualia? Or fish? What about honey bees? Somewhere down the phylogenetic scale phenomenal consciousness ceases. But where? It is sometimes supposed that once we begin to reflect upon much simpler beings than ourselves — snails, for example — we are left with nothing physical or structural that we could plausibly take to help us determine whether they are phenomenally conscious (Papineau 1994). There is really no way of our knowing if spiders are subject to states with qualia, as they spin their webs, or if fish undergo any phenomenal experiences, as they swim about in the sea.
Representationalism has the beginnings of an answer to the above questions. If what it is for a state to have phenomenal character is (very roughly) that it be a state that (i) carries information about certain features, internal or external, and (ii) is such that this information stands ready and available to make a direct difference to beliefs and desires (or belief- and desire-like states), then creatures that are incapable of reasoning, of changing their behavior in light of assessments they make, based upon information provided to them by sensory stimulation of one sort or another, are not phenomenally conscious. Tropistic organisms, on this view, feel and experience nothing. They have no qualia. They are full-fledged unconscious automata or zombies, rather as blindsight subjects are restricted unconscious automata or partial zombies with respect to a range of visual stimuli.
Consider, for example, the case of plants. There are many different sorts of plant behavior. Some plants climb, others eat flies, still others catapult out seeds. Many plants close their leaves at night. The immediate cause of these activities is something internal to the plants. Seeds are ejected because of the hydration or dehydration of the cell walls in seed pods. Leaves are closed because of water movement in the stems and petioles of the leaves, itself induced by changes in the temperature and light. These inner events or states are surely not phenomenal. There is nothing it is like to be a Venus Fly Trap or a Morning-Glory.
The behavior of plants is inflexible. It is genetically determined and, therefore, not modifiable by learning. Natural selection has favored the behavior, since historically it has been beneficial to the plant species. But it need not be now. If, for example, flies start to carry on their wings some substance that sickens Venus Fly Traps for several days afterwards, this will not have any effect on the plant behavior with respect to flies. Each Venus Fly Trap will continue to snap at flies as long as it has the strength to do so.
Plants do not learn from experience. They do not acquire beliefs and change them in light of things that happen to them. Nor do they have any desires. To be sure, we sometimes speak as if they do. We say that the wilting daffodils are just begging to be watered. But we recognize full well that this is a harmless façon de parler. What we mean is that the daffodils need water. There is here no goal-directed behavior, no purpose, nothing that is the result of any learning, no desire for water.
Plants, on the representational view, are not subject to any qualia. Nothing that goes on inside them is poised to make a direct difference to what they believe or desire, since they have no beliefs or desires.
Reasoning of the above sort can be used to make a case that even though qualia do not extend to plants and paramecia, qualia are very widely distributed in nature (see Tye 1997, 2000). Of course, such a case requires decisions to be made about the attribution of beliefs and desires (or belief- and desire-like states) to much simpler creatures. And such decisions are likely to be controversial in some cases. Moreover, representationalism itself is a very controversial position. The general topic of the origins of qualia is not one on which philosophers have said a great deal.
(stanford article on qualia)
A reduction to metaphor and abstraction can often make more powerful. The fact that it relies on people’s inherent knowledge is a strength!
Environment is perfect for superstition as an unpredictable system.

Believability does not require human form.
Domains/environments of these animals are important as well - Some of
these environments will be new to children and young people, and in themselves may offer chal-
lenges and opportunities for discovery.

Applying inexpensive AI techniques - if most of the CPU power is caught up in world generation, make the AI a PART of the ‘world’ of the game.
Interdependence notes also useful here - interdependence between man and environment. We live in it, as agents. Like our existence in a game.


As Laurel says, just because a computer does not manifest its action as an entity, always, does not mean that it is not acting; it always acts.

There is a usability/narrative point to this as well, demonstrated by the above quote by Garrard. Patience, waiting, the chance of missing things, is part of an interaction with any unpredictable network, and I think it is a worthy artistic pursuit to instil patience, wonder and observation into people’s interaction with non-tool software. 



Such environments have rules for the safety and care of both humans and animals,
which establish important boundaries. In a stable, for example, there will be rules about running
and shouting, and also about putting things away and cleaning up.  - ritual and special rules.

Qualia featuring in human experiences of landscapes.
According to Greg Garrard, there is an “overemphasis on violence and sex” in nature programming. We must find some gap between this which is meaningful for the creature, as both of those are quite difficult when it has no partner!


Simon’s Ant - Hebert Simon seeing complexity in actually very simple actions. We come up with complex reasons for the complex path it takes. The ant, in contrast, is actually just taking things one step at a time. It is the appearance of complexity.
“The point here is that the ‘main character’ in this situation was not the complex thing, rather it was the environment that was complex” - related to AI in general, and to environmental storytelling in games. 
We need to remove things from everyday life, to exalt them, to understand them
Whatever it may be, animals have always had, until our era, a divine or sacrificial nobility that all mythologies recount. Even murder by hunting is still a symbolic relation, as opposed to an experimental dissection.
Even domestication is still a symbolic relation, as opposed to industrial breeding.

 The trajectory animals have followed, from divine sacrifice to dog cemeteries with atmospheric music, from sacred defiance to ecological sentimentality, speaks loudly enough of the vulgarization of the status of man himself - it once again describes an unexpected reciprocity between the two.
It is proportional to this disdain. It is in proportion to being relegated to irresponsibility, to the inhuman, that the animal becomes worthy of the human ritual of affection and protection, just as the child does in direct proportion to being relegated to a status of innocence and childishness.

It is the reabsorption of all violence in regard to them that today forms the monstrosity of beasts.

The violence of sacrifice, which is one of &quot;intimacy&quot; (Bataille), has been succeeded by the sentimental or experimental violence that is one of distance.

The original monstrosity of the beast, object of terror and fascination, but never negative, always ambivalent, object of exchange also and of metaphor, in sacrifice, in mythology, in the heraldic bestiary, and even in our dreams and our phantasms - this monstrosity, rich in every threat and every metamorphosis, one that is secretly resolved in the living culture of men, and that is a form of alliance, has been exchanged for a spectacular monstrosity: that of King Kong wrenched from his jungle and transformed into a music-hall star.

 Animals, like the dead, and so many others, have followed this uninterrupted process of annexation through extermination, which consists of liquidation, then of making the extinct species speak, of making them present the confession of their disappearance. Making animals speak, as one has made the insane, children, sex (Foucault) speak. This is even deluded in regard to animals, whose principle of uncertainty, which they have caused to weigh on men since the rupture in their alliance with men, resides in the fact that they do not speak. The challenge of madness has historically been met by the hypothesis of the unconscious

 Qualitative organicism is
a position which claims, first, a kind of middle road position, that is, on
the one hand, there are no mysterious or non-material vital powers
in organisms (non-vitalism), but on the other hand, the characteristic
properties of living beings cannot be fully accounted for by physics
and chemistry because these properties are nonreducible emergent
properties (emergentism)

“Bestiality must be killed in animals” - we experiment on animals to assuage ourselves that there is no such thing as unexplainable wildness; we must account for everything. 

Baudrillard is talking ‘a lot’ about the deenchanting of our surroundings. Autocosmics is important to enchantment. Indeed, this is what enchantment is!

Once animals had a more sacred, more divine character than men. There is not even a reign of the &quot;human&quot; in primitive societies, and for a long time the animal order has been the order of reference. Only the animal is worth being sacrificed, as a god, the sacrifice of man only comes afterward, according to a degraded order. Men qualify only by their affiliation to the animal: the Bororos &quot;are&quot; macaws. This is not of the prelogical or psychoanalytic order - nor of the mental order of classification, to which Levi-Strauss reduced the animal effigy (even if it is still fabulous that animals served as a language, this was also part of their divinity)-no, this signifies that Bororos and macaws are part of a cycle, and that the figure of the cycle excludes any division of species, any of the distinctive oppositions upon which we live. The structural opposition is diabolic, it divides and confronts distinct identities: such is the division of the Human, which throws beasts into the Inhuman - the cycle, itself, is symbolic: it abolishes the positions in a reversible enchainment - in this sense, the Bororos &quot;are&quot; macaws, in the same way that the Canaque say the dead walk among the living. (Does Deleuze envision something like that in his becoming-animal and when he says &quot;Be the rose panther!&quot;?)

In particular, our sentimentality toward animals is a sure sign of the disdain in which we hold them.

My focus on autocosmics, in its broadest sense, precludes using these ideas solely for creating characters in art; characters surround us, whether self-created or created by others. What arenas of life other than the arts might benefit from resonant interactive characters, or environments?

When interacting with media, Reeves and Nass (1996) argue, “people should be able to use what comes naturally – rules for social relationships and rules for navigating the physical world,” (p. 255). People already know how to function in the natural world (be polite, how to handle difficult personalities) so designers should take these reactions and phenomena into consideration when designing new media.

Further uses of gestural computing.

Direct Manipulation Interface 
Term introduced by Ben Shneiderman. This is opposed to a textual or command-line interface; an object-based interface with metaphor, affordance and naive physics in which things move and act much like they would in real life. Also characterised by incremental change, rather than the more monolithic changes that come from issuing distinct commands to a computer. It does not necessarily have to be graphical; can incorporate sound or haptics.

Returning to the ‘cabinet’ idea.

Noted (like others re. children) - that young children focussed on outer characteristics of characters, older children internal.
Using character-led teaching techniques to allow children to understand plot and narrative BETTER and with greater understanding (by following them through the text). Character as SUPPORTING narrative, as providing understanding, resonance as a tool not just to emotion, buyt to actual understanding.

R.G. Collingweood - rethink the thoughts of past people in order to understand their history. “The history of though… is the renactment of past thought in the historian’s own mind”. But, as critics such as Patrick Gardiner have stated, we cannot fully simulate another’ state of mind.

What John Tinnell calls the “ubiquitous computing paradigm” - no spaces away from networked, trilling noise.
Which is, of course, the promise of AI - the Internet of Things, networked databases, constant wireless access. This makes reflection, solitude and the magic circle very difficult to conjure. Perhaps this is why making good art digitally is difficult? Attention spans are low.
The magic circle is not only difficult to conjure, but where would its boundaries be defined? With a book, or a film, this is easy, and is aided by the physical design of the art’s material space to match its conceptual space. With ‘ubicomp’ (Tinnell’s phrase, perhaps borrowed from elsewhere) we don’t have those spaces “bracketed off [from] the distractions of open air spontaneity”.
 Madrigal, quoted in Tinnell; “No one knows how to create words and pictures that are meant to be consumed out there in the world”.

Return to baudrillard and the power of autocosmics.

imulacra and simulation

Not sure of Baudrillard's m,oral position on 'good' and 'bad' copies of reality being 'accurate' and 'inaccurate'

The creature is a sign pretending to be a faithful copy - like characters?
Arbitrary images are merely suggested as things which they have no relationship to.
&quot;the order of sorcery&quot; - the assumption of a great teleology.
Think about &quot;user journey&quot; - one person at a time, 10 mins each? How do they go into it?
What are the &quot;good choices&quot; for the user?
autocosmics already used a huge amount in heritage, study of history - focussing on idvidual stories, using characters as ciphers for exhibitions etc.

Digital god you make a pilgrimage to. Interesting and fascinating. Starts as soon as they hear about it. (this ties to player sympathy.


Being in an installation means the interaction time is much smaller.

 P.14 - talks about Flow’s (Chen) ideal being hampered by people having to use a six-axis and view on a screen - the context is important. 

Smell

Wharton as a characteristic digital environment in heritage.

Rather than mimicking the inside, Bryson says (in embodiment and mimetics) that we should embody an agent, use its environment to provide personality. 

Exhibition in a hut on hill in derbyshire?

Obviously there is a ‘physical’ closeness and intimacy with the creature, in that you are directly manipulating its features and experiencing it in real time, as you would a ‘living’ agent. Empathy is a key part of my research, in no small part generated by the creature’s dependence upon you as an ill person; a different sort of intimacy is explored here, that of physical and personal intimacy as evinced in the field of palliative care, exacerbated by the vivisectionist, biological control which the player will continue to have over the creature. However, the acolyte relies on the creature for the experience to exist at all, and relies upon its power as a god, activated by the rituals in the ‘holy manual’, to have any sort of experience with it at all. If there is a consensus to partake at all, then a dependency is formed. If that dependency is broken, the acolyte has already walked away from the experience, and the bond is broken anyway.

This is an interdependence, which I would like to explore in the relationship going forward; actions taken together, actions remembered physically or mentally, a growing understanding of the creature both as system and individual, will increase the bond between player and creature. This is something which needs to be maintained in the long-term, over the entire timescale of the experience.

Interdependence, in the main, should be a pleasurable experience; though of course Watts is not interested in changing this dynamic to create dramatic effect. I am! Therefore, the interdependency will change as the experience goes on; it will become more desperate, more morally grey, and more uncanny. This is part of my artistic remit; the limits of character empathy, of paracosmic interaction.

“What is the reader;s attitude to (a work of) fiction before reading it… and while reading it?”
close the door, turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and experience Uru
We need to remove things from everyday life, to exalt them, to understand them
Murray - ““Live theater has been incorpiorating the same qualities of spontaneity and audience involvement for some time.”
You must “script the interactor as well as the program”.



Courting The Acolyte’s Sympathies

This is a cultural issue, partially outside the remit of the character’s digital environment and self. I must be concerned with how the wider culture impacts on people coming to my creature, and what I can do to mitigate their expectations of what is a limited medium, engage them in a consensual experience (in which we all agree to suspend disbelief and engage in a magic circle) and provoke their paracosmic sympathies as audience. This will be especially important for my Recipes Model, in which we directly ask players to bring items into the game experience themselves. This section is designed to mitigate inherent knowledge, or at least assumed knowledge, about how the creature works mechanically. In reference to theatre (and applying the same observation to computing) Brenda Laurel says that “audience members are simply not aware of the technical aspects at all” . However, I am not sure how true this is. It is certainly not true of every audience; some may have more inherent knowledge than others, and while their paracosmic tendencies might override many of these, complete ignorance or lack of opinion on how a computer does work should not be assumed. This is different, it is important to note, from how a computer should work, which is something we want to court.

One’s interactions with something are not only concrete and first-person; they come in how one approaches it as a cultural concept, how one talks about it, the grammar employed; we create a context in which we approach the work, especially when it comes to AI. The AI Effect (the idea that when something has become a mainstream technology we know longer consider it intelligent, as we previously did) is well-known. What is more, people are actively hostile towards AI, the presumption of AI, and wish eagerly to disprove it. I must not make these presumptions, or at least not make them apparent.

&quot;All play moves and has its being within a playground marked off befordhand either materially or ideally&quot; p.1

Who is it meant for? One person over and over or lots individually? Could be both; different experiences (ascribe changes/discrepancies to either characters or other players)
Where do they first hear about it?
Digital media as performative
You are a performer with the creature
Performance = “bodily co-presence” - realting to your autocosmic performance with creature to create a whole.
Ian Reader - “formalised and organised means of interactions”“Wizard of oz” technique - behind the curtain. 
The creature’s innards are behind a curtain - this is the drama.
As in Japan - a torii delineates a sacred space (ian reader), “leaving one’s everyday routines”, ritual actions. 
“The fundamental condition of performance is the encounter between performer and spectator within a set of design parameters.”
PED is about the experienc whilst using technology, not the end result - I am interested in both. Away from “focus on products… [instead] unarchibable, intangible interactions.
Dionysian expeirence - being, through art, in the presenve of a god (Laurel) - art and games proved a sacred space entered
“In here, the meaning of the ordinary is transformed.”
For virtual reality to fulfill its highest potential, we must reinvent the sacred spaces where we collaborate with reality in order to transform it and ourselves.”
Samyn - for an “audience of one” - R-TAM.

Brenda Laurel and her book Computers as Theatre is my touchstone for this; in this book, she advocates for seeing the user/computer relationship as like a performer/audience relationship, as a “representation on stage”, in many different ways, and that through the application of techniques of performance (in her case, theatrical performance) better applications and systems will be developed.
“Heightened attention to the present moment.”
About the dynamics rather than the statics.
Talks about “enactment” - one user performing directly with technology in public (Sarah Ayers) as opposed to “staging”. “Self-performance” as well as performance to others.

In simulation, signs merely reflect other signs - no reality. 

1st-order simulation - premodern - clearly an artificial placemarker for the real. (characters in books, the creature - not going towards the hyperreal)
2nd-order - mass-produced items no longer individual, but commodiities - imitating realities, no one true object.
3rd-roder - the simulacrum has replaced the original, and the distinction between reality and representation vanishes. 
The map precedes the territoruy - the precession of simulacra.

r - not a template or blueprint for making characters, though I hope it is useful in this regard. Only really about making this one character - not a system for including characters like versu or x or x.
Creative Computing - Hongji and Andrew differentiate it from computational creativity, which is an engineering thing. “Doing computations in a creative way” - this isn’t the focus of my work.
CC “seeks to reconcile the objective precision of computer systems (mathesis) with the subjective ambiguity of human creativity (aethesis). 

Games have an element of design, usability - we do not have to think how to use a book. Maybe this will be the way with computers in the future.
BUT - I’m interested in heartbeat monitors and stuff - am I really? 

We are exiting the sacred phase of society - collective animism (IoT) combined with tech utopianism. We don’t understand our devices. We now look for reenchantment that correlates with science.

According to Koster, part of the problem is “fail[ing] to model human society well enough to encourage good behaviour”; this must be my goal. Not to model human society, but rather to model life, and the themes of devotion, service, care and empathy to that life in order to encourage introspection on behaviour.

Lack Of Knowledge/Interest Around Subject

This sort of folklore is a small field, certainly until the turn of the millenium (not many referencing Wilby).
“The term cunning-folk is little-known today” (Davies)
De Blecourt, Davies and others always referencing the 17th century witch trials and coopting much of the scholarship time and effort.
De Blecourt goes as far as to say that Keith Thomas “discovered” cunning folk in Britain - were really not covered at all.
Quotes Tekla Domotor - “scientists were so fascinated and horrified by the prominent features of the witch trials that they hardly paid attention to common folk.”
Owen Davies - “how little we really know about cunning-folk”, “paucity of relevant research”
“Elusive characters”.
“Cunning-folk were as much a part of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century society as they were of the seventeenth, but until recently historians have neglected to investigate their continued social importance”
“Cunning-folk left little record of their thoughts and experiments.”
“Cunning-folk, on the other hand, did not engage in literary debate”


Compared to the huge and ever increasing historiography concerning the
main period of the witch trials, then, the history of witchcraft and magic in
the period academia refers to as either the Enlightenment period, or the less
value-laden ‘long eighteenth century’, is in its infancy.

Industrial Revolution &amp; Enlightenment
(Harding)
“Fiscally stagnated agrarian communities”
Roberta Harding - people broken in factories, no healthcare (expensive or dangerous or useless), awful conditions.
“Intellectually the whole basis for witchcraft and magic was being questioned.”
Growth of printing press, transport, literacy.

Capital Punishment
(Harding)
Roberta Harding , quoting Atholl (p49) “the gallows and gibbet were as much a part of the English landscape as windmills were a part of the Dutch”
“Capital punishment was an omnipresent fixture”
“86% of all executions carried out in London and its environs were for crimes against property”
The Waltham Act of 1722 - Can be killed for stealing or defacing property; the new middle class protecting their assets (Roberta Harding, quoting Laurence -”Property, even more than person, was under the guardianship of the gallows”)

Familiars

A form of ‘virtual being’ based on autocosmics surrounding superstitions, animals and characterisation.
Spontaneous folk belief, not based on elite writings: (Wilby) - not an ‘elite construction’. 
Animal forms, not particularly supernatural. Perhaps because of fear of the unnatural as being outside God, also because animals formed a symbiotic relationship with everyday people. (Wilby) “The familiar most frequently appeared in animal form, often living in domestic intimacy with the witch.”
Part of a continuum which included many different sorts of spirits - (Wilby) “Categories of spirit overlapped considerably.”
Familiar denoted “both the witch’s demonic spirit and… personal helping spirits”.
“But familiars and fairies were believed to possess a range of supernatural powers that were considered capable of affecting almost any aspect of human life”
Parallel to the hobman, “living alone… either alongside humans in their houses”.
“The affectionate and intimate relationship often found between the witch/cunning woman and her familiar/fairy”.
“Others claimed to encounter them on a more regular basis, commonly developing a particularly close relationship with one or more spirits.”
“The individual was usually alone, either in the countryside or at home, or in some sort of trouble”
“Promise of help to ease the witch’s material suffering”


Prejudice Against Women/A Woman’s Role


￼￼￼

“The riddle why so many women were singled out for prosecution has thus mainly been left unexplained” (de Bleacourt)
“Some cunning women were married or lived with partners”
“Being a cunning-woman was one of the few outlets for a woman to gain significant social influence and personal prosperity.”
“It is quite possible that throughout her social career such a woman would have moved up and down the good/bad continuum depending on how her acts were judged by her neighbours and overlords”
“The daughters of artisans, tradesmen or small farmers were more likely to be literate than those of labourers”

Versu is to do with norms and how far you step away from them - just like religion! “Norm violation” - can’t allow player’s total freedom to do what they like all the time?

Design often shows elements from the story in other configurations (spikes in the prince of persia manual, both arabic decoration and precursor of your most feared enemy. 

Subtle, themic decoration around page borders of non-story pages.
Difference between game manuals and car manuals, for example, is that the former is voluntary - simulated problems, but talked about as if they couldn’t be overcome with extra coding - they are part of the magic circle already. The others are for real problems - still voluntary, but hard limits of machine, not the artificial limits of the program.

Uses “you” to refer to the player in their different roles throughout the different campaigns.
“You already have 16 victories to your credit” - setting the expectation for your victory.

Must be simple for the creature to use as input - simplify knowledge representation through ritualisation. 
Explaining all of the icons, unlike a grimoire - a grimoire uses the symbols as exclusionary, paracosmic symbols, that only certain people can learn - in the game manual, they are explained so that in the game they do not need to do it

I disagree with Crawford that social interaction is the only way forward for storytelling in games - as in religion, art etc, things can showcase people.

RECABUSTIRA, CABUSTIRA, BUSTIRA, TIRA RA, A - another word play.

Instruction manuals come with warnings/admonitions with special glyphs - warnings both for the user and for the appliance.
Diagrams/maps of the territory of the appliance.
Recipes for success in using it!
Rituals for safety very often - tell you to make sure it is plugged in (a legal thing, a ritualistic behaviour).
Translating messages from the machine.
How to make the machine happy.
If it has encountered a problem (not what the problem actually is).
Manuals are part of the design of things from the start, while holy books try to reverse engineer things already created - that’s what the Holy manual does here.
When to shake the chips in the fryer - doing its rituals to get what you want.
Tiny, contextual messages - must have the book to understand them.
Program instructions for human! Follow steps to the letter. But they don’t, therefore accidents happen.
“CAN BE AFFECTED  by electrical storms” - portentous, 
Entering codes that the computer understands but which you do not.
“Some experimenting” may be required sometimes - go off piste WITHIN the parameters.
Failsafes - you cannot clean both sides automatically, must be done manually.
Central CODE function on the fryer to access all functions occultly.
Sometimes won’t display things, but they will be happening - they reassure you of this, but we need that to happen without reassurance in characters!
Warnings over emissions in car 
“Congratulations on acquiring your new Lincoln”
Remember to pass on the Owner’s Guide when reselling the vehicle. It
is an integral part of the vehicle.
Symbols for hilighting specific sorts of text (tree, exclamation mark etc.)
Symbols relate to what is wrong -converting into human semiotics.
Dashboard cluster is like a face, warning you of problems - not divining, told directly. 
You can even see all the unlit warning signs in the sunshine, the possibility space of the mechanism.
-Things that are dangerous it warns you about, mainly, otherwise you are in a ‘normal operation’.
Arrows show you motions to undertake alongside verbs in the text.
Your Lincoln Navigation System has a large range of features, yet is easy
to use
‘Your’ - it belongs to you.
Things that you may say to the system.
Does not tell you everything about the inner workings of the thing - just the performative ‘user’ bit.
“Courtesy” lamps - the manufacturers deemed it useful if not necessary.
These things you see? They are normal - your initial impression is wrong (condensation in headlights, treatment of animals in zoos).
Warnings before anything else in sections.
On hot days, the temperature in the trunk or vehicle interior can
rise very quickly. Exposure of people or animals to these high
temperatures for even a short time can cause death or serious
heat-related injuries, including brain damage. Small children are
particularly at risk.
Resetting requires what appear to be obsessive actions! Doing things 8 times in a row etc. (I suppose to stop accidental usage) - ritual must be deliberate, and so must be strange.
Capitals and bold to draw attention to potential danger/mistakes.
The mechanisms in the car immediately let you know the culture surrounding the car - seatbelts etc.	
“Tongue” of a seatbelt
Mysterious residue from airbags - like ectoplasm, must be explained…
Unpredictable, animist components in the car that must be treated properly.
Precise instructions on what to do, what NOT to do,
Everybody does some of these, nobody does all of them - a platonic acolyte.
The appliance is your servant, but is unpredictable - YOU must take some responsibility for it. 	
Checking engine oil - abstract barometer
Some instances slip outside the realm of the manual and into terror, autocosmic suggestion - “immediately call a physician” and that’s it.
Pre-recorded “blocks” of personality always seem fake. Unpredictability is the key.

Success in “micro worlds” in early AI - very limited domains. Still the case now? But needed a huge amount of commonsense knowledge to expand the worlds to more generalised domains. DARPA funding dried up, no money for AI.

Expertise is a sort of micro-world.

Extending this kind of ability to larger worlds

“Seeing man as an information-processing system does not in itself dehumanise him.”
Intelligence is hard to automate! - Steven Wolfram - “nobody had any real idea for how hard that might be”
Brains may not be the best model for intelligence in machines - just as wheels are better than legs. Wolfram “don’t have to go through this sort of intermediate route of building a human-like, brain-like thing in order to achieve computational knowledge”

CRIT - Wolfram assumes that the task of AI is to automate intellectual activities of human - but maybe not. The rerm does not include the task to be done by it. 
Link paracosmics to ‘scruffy AI’ - “hackers who will connle together a system built of anything” (from Neat vs. Scruffy AI) as opposed to neats, which must be “provably sound and complete” - detached, omniapplicable. Nothing like art.




Huizinga - “play… plays itself to an end… it is over.”
In other forms of art, basic things are taken for granted which cannot be taken for granted in computing - maybe this is an argument for 
Expressing a detailed interactive character’s behavior in Hap is an artistic expression just
as painting or animation is. The difference isthat thetools that must be used arenot abrush
or pen and ink, but rather a programminglanguage.
Huizinga - play’s power lies in repetition.
Study and Build the Unique: Generality is Good Com-
puter Science but Bad Believability
Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence as a part of it, rewards, values and pursues
general solutions to problems. This is appropriate for much of computer science because
general solutions are possible, and are more useful than narrow solutions.
In believable agents, however, the nature of the problem is in conflict with generality.
Believableagentsarelargelyabouttheunique. NoonegoestoseeInspectorClouseauinthe
famous Pink Panther movies because he is a general solution to the “believable character”
problem. They go to see him because of the individual personality and character that is
brought to life on the screen.
To make progress toward building interactive versions of such powerful characters we
need to embrace this aspect of the problem. As discussed earlier, this seems to require
that the envisioned personality permeate the decisions made when developing all aspects

166 Chapter 10. Issues and Guidelines for Building Believable Agents
of an agent, abstract or concrete, low-level or high-level. If that means that particular
solutions have less generality than we would like, that is infinitely better progress than
general solutions that don’t address the problem.

What is an agent vs. An dynamic object? Is a character in a book merely a dynamic object?
“Much of the resistance to artificial intelligence has been on mystical grounds, as was resistance to natural selection” - Minsky.




that is that for any set of values set on such a machinethere is not just one character that fits
those values, but rather an infinite set of characters that fit them. 1 And they want to choose
and create a particular character. The details are everything. -&gt; artists understand this.

He believes we choose low-level tools (not templates) because we want control over the details.

 Many characters are irrational. Some might argue that those are the interesting
ones. Authors need to be able to build believable agents that are irrational. If believable
agent researchers adopt the assumption of rationality in their research, they run the risk of
blocking the construction of believable agent versions of these rich characters

For believable agents, appropriate limits both mentally and physically
are needed.

The Populist Views Of AI - There are all sorts of competing views, held by different strata of society; that AI is not actually intelligent, that it is a route to terrifying dystopia, that it will kill off jobs, that it should be able to act exactly like a human, and so on. All of these must be mitigated in the surrounding discussion (my marketing and explanations of the project, such as on the Github repository or Twitter) and in the materials of the game itself, especially in the opening phases of the game and the ‘holy manual’. Floridi from the Oxford Internet Institute is a good example in calling AI ‘smart technology’ rather than AI. This mediates expectations on both sides. It is, of course, as I explain elsewhere, important for me what language I am using, even in talking to myself, is important to how I choose to build my systems.

Bryson - ai and moral agents - “exaggerated fears and hopes” - actually all AI promises us the same as any human artefact. Computers are just a tool. 
“Fear of functionalism” - becoming tools outselves.
OR we inappropriately heighten the worth or ability of the machine.
Technology, in general, should be used for understanding our choices and ourselves. 
The Desires Of Game Players - This is dealt with more in the other section, but it is important to note here. Laurel points to it as well, this desire to disrupt, to seek ‘instrumental agency’, to get ‘under the hood’ - I think that it is perhaps a more important activity amongst ‘hardcore’ gamers, rather than ‘casual’ gamers, but that remains to be seen; it is seen most evidently, I feel, in Let’s Plays; while players try to be sympathetic and get into the magic circle, there is a certain cynicism that creeps in eventually as they chunk the gamespace, become less sympathetic towards the inevitable flaws, and try to see it as a complete representation of a thing, rather than an impressionistic, delimited system that resembles a thing. Of course, this is what players do; they are always narrowing down options, making sense, chunking, bringing things to inevitable conclusions. It cannot be avoided, and it is not a bad thing intrinsically. However, it must be mediated and managed. Here is an illuminating quote from two Halo developers:

“Early versions of Halo’s AI had a short pause between seeing you and recognizing that you were an enemy. This was to allow people to get the jump on the AI or retreat if they were getting in over their heads. Playtest feedback showed that players assumed this Feature was a Bug and they all said it made the AI look dumb.”
 . We need to prevent people from ‘introducing new potential’, unknowns that are outside the remit of the system. There is a psychological element here, that relates well to the partiality that we see elsewhere, particularly in paracosmics; many games state that they do not want constraints, invisible walls; that they want freedom to explore a world before them. However, when restraints are removed, the experience is often less satisfying; indeed, I would say always less satisfying. What is more, the restraints are never truly removed; only expanded and loosened through the application of time, money, people and technology. This is the tension; the very-well-grounded ideas of art as a partial representation completed by a player’s mind implicitly, and the promise of digital games to craft free worlds explicitly. I think Minecraft and its ilk come the closest to combining the two.

He also works on creating emotions in robots, again to benefit their human co-workers, or rather “non-verbal behavioural cues”. There is a real performative aspect to Leon’s work here (a robot must have ‘perceptions of effortfulness”, must seem as if it cares), though Leon stresses the importance that outward display of emotions by robots must coincide with some corresponding internal state, otherwise they are not useful. This would be ‘false feedback’ and could be alienating, misleading or even dangerous.
We could, then, think of behaviours as ‘solutions’ to ‘problem’ emotions; perhaps this is a way to look at the internal structure of the creature.
Fleetingness of communication increases emotional value, not decreases - make transitory, ephemeral interactions
People think that they don’t want constraint - but it must be constrained to promote an interesting experience and another’s vision. Define the possibility space - the “options considered viable”.
Emily Short - “these players are angry because they feel they’ve been offered freedom but have found their options constrained by a worldview unlike their own. 
“Soft scale” - passive audience, guided but restricted actor, fully-active agent “when a system provides little to no guided storytelling.” - agent not always good for player as dilutes and abstracts designer visionj
Harold Laswell - theories of “transmission” communication - getting meaning across (tied to empathy, isimulation etc. 
Communicator -&gt; transmitter -&gt; (channel) -&gt; messages -&gt; receiver -&gt; effects
Miranda July - “we watched this technology being invented and we fee like we should be behind the curtain and there should be no mystery.”
Samyn (R-TAM) - “do not hide behind the freedom of the user in an interactive environment to ignore your responsibility as creator.” 
The user “takes the body into the experience.”
“The user is not disemboded but is provided with a device which allows him or her to visit a place that would otherwise not be accessible.”

Watts is primarily focussed on interdependence as a measure of closeness; how can actions, contexts and objects increase feelings of closeness? While in Watts’ case this is focussed on human-human closeness facilitated by machines, I am more interested in closeness between an agent (who perhaps, for all intents for purposes, is related to in a similar way as a human being ‘inside the machine’ when on-screen) and the human interactor. It is centred around four tenets: Closeness, Empathy, Emotional Awareness, Intimacy. 


Obviously there is a ‘physical’ closeness and intimacy with the creature, in that you are directly manipulating its features and experiencing it in real time, as you would a ‘living’ agent. Empathy is a key part of my research, in no small part generated by the creature’s dependence upon you as an ill person; a different sort of intimacy is explored here, that of physical and personal intimacy as evinced in the field of palliative care, exacerbated by the vivisectionist, biological control which the player will continue to have over the creature. However, the acolyte relies on the creature for the experience to exist at all, and relies upon its power as a god, activated by the rituals in the ‘holy manual’, to have any sort of experience with it at all. If there is a consensus to partake at all, then a dependency is formed. If that dependency is broken, the acolyte has already walked away from the experience, and the bond is broken anyway.

This is an interdependence, which I would like to explore in the relationship going forward; actions taken together, actions remembered physically or mentally, a growing understanding of the creature both as system and individual, will increase the bond between player and creature. This is something which needs to be maintained in the long-term, over the entire timescale of the experience.

Interdependence, in the main, should be a pleasurable experience; though of course Watts is not interested in changing this dynamic to create dramatic effect. I am! Therefore, the interdependency will change as the experience goes on; it will become more desperate, more morally grey, and more uncanny. This is part of my artistic remit; the limits of character empathy, of paracosmic interaction.

Evans states that agents provoke simple, more polar reactions. Maybe this is the problem. Maybe we need to move away from agents as components in a system. 
He uses the Sims 3 as an example, a game that abstracts personality and emotion - there is a fear to meet it face-on. 
Useful to systematise personality and preference into numbers -&gt; creates choice, variation and depth
 Difference between “wide” and “narrow” broadcast of emotions.
Weiz - we have taken the processing of problems out of our brains and into computers, and we make insipid decisions based on their outputs. - put processing back into human brain.


Interdependence

As Prof. Patrick Wilson says in his ‘Introduction to AI’ lectures at MIT, the player of a game is the “meat needed to feed the game”; this phrase points to an interdependence for existence between a ‘player’ (who would not be a player if they did not come to the game) and the ‘game’ (which would be just a collection of rules and data ready to be processed without an agent to activate them meaningfully). Out of this interdependence, and its fulfilment, comes meaningful experience with interactive systems.
Emergence vs. Encoded intelligence, syntactic vs. Semantic approach How psychologically present is the creature
Reasers and rusers - relaxed reasoning or implicit fakery (Leon)


This is one of the dramatic hearts of the project; the shifting balance of power between the creature (nominally the adored icon, a fetish object. ) and the acolyte (nominally its caretaker, nurse, confidante and priest). At any one time, who is dominant in the relationship? Who (to borrow game terminology) is ‘winning’? This is tied into questions of consent, influence, negotiation, parlay, empathy, supplication, kowtowing and confinement.

This is, at its centre, a question of protagonism; who is the centre of the experience, start to finish? This is a question that is not often put to literary characters, as our mastery over them, as their paracosmic enactors, is ambient; it is not facilitated and kickstarted by interaction. In the creature, there is both paracosmic and actual enaction. 

Leon likes that I started with breathing - we may not need to call it intelligence - maybe life is what is important instead.

Tale of Tales - Like Renaissance-era master painters and Flemish primitives, they see themselves as working with the high technology of the time to tell stories that are nonetheless an ancient part of Western culture.

Like “home editions” of tryptichs

Whereas physical art is experienced by sharing the same space as an object, he explains, digital art instead asks viewers to share time with it instead. -&gt; disagree with Samyn’s ideas of physical places

To take advantage of their digital nature, the cabinets will be animated, portraying specific biblical scenes and making dramatic twists to explain the significance of the character portrayed. However, Samyn insisted that the pieces not be viewed as “alive” so much as being virtual statues, again calling back to the art that influenced the project. “We’re very inspired by the style of medieval sculpture,” explained Samyn. “But also by African sculpture and even some modernists.” Rather than wanting the scenes to be photorealistic, he prefers that they be read as “symbolic representations of a realm that cannot be perceived.”

For the cathedral half of the project, which will collect all of the Saint depictions into a single virtual reality app, the duo expects a bit more work from its users. Whereas the saint depictions are being made with availability in mind, the cathedral will instead require users to overcome a number of barriers, including the cost of virtual reality, the discomfort of wearing a VR headset, and the public perception of VR as a “very nerdy, very uncool thing to do.” This is meant to symbolize the sacrifices medieval Christians would have to make to show their devotion, similar to how a monk might wear an uncomfortable hairshirt as a way to humble himself before God. Like planning a trip to Ghent to visit its famous cathedrals, Samyn stated that “a sort of pilgrimage will be needed to see our cathedral.”




Computer programs require specific ‘ifs’ to be in place first - just like this

Emmanuel Tanguy - facial animations “could influence people’s perception of a virtual actor” - different facial expressions but displayed concurrently. 2 types of emotions/facial expressions - serconday emotion and mood. Mood is a chording effect, a modifier, each displayed together to display complex emotion.
Call them “experiments” - interesting.

Wið Cyrnel - counting down - like a game.
The ‘holy manual’, the more traditional, fixed interpretation of my ‘Platonic character’, is as important to visually and structurally design as my digital interpretation. Though we may popularly think of the textual object as fixed, unchanging, traditional, parochial, undynamic, linear etc. etc. We must remember that text, the book and other related concepts are technologies, as surely as computers are: naturalised technologies, formalised by commerce, but artificial extensions of ourself nonetheless. Therefore, their construction and design, particularly in their adherence or departure from traditional forms, will influence our relationship with them. The dynamic in this project is not a simple digital/physical, new/old one; both are different ways of engaging with character, manipulating the audience’s paracosmic tendencies, and of trying new things. The novel is only one form of character, a very restricted one; character is not isolated to them, but is spread across human existence.

‘Present-day simulators attempt to make the real, all of the real, coincide with their models of simulation’

“Resonance” is a general quality, achieved through a specific use of media and general kwotwing to an audience’s autocosmics.
There is a difference between game characters as engineering success and artistic success. They can be brought together, but rarely are.
I am an artist approaching the issue of game characters: could argue that this requires a literacy that I do not have.
Game characters are often either not resonant, not interactive or potential filling, or neither. This is the inadequacy.
An artist coming in - I want to privilege the autocosmic over algorithmic - but with game characters, cannot just focus on examples from other forms, but on more interactive resonant characters from outside the arts. But char as enviro doesn’t fit this?!
AI can get both more or less information than its human partner. If you do not impose artificial restrictions, it will not be a compelling experience.

Videogame manuals often describe the history, the past, what has happened up until that point, dropping you in media res. It delineates the space that you will be occupying by giving it context. In the original Prince of Persia, you have been imprisoned by Jaffar, therefore your escape has meaning; not just to save the princess, but to save the princess in time.
Flying Corp - representing everything possible. The planes are the characters, and manipulation of them crosses the social/spatial/systemic manipulation divide. Especially  because they are so complex.

The simulation is good enough that you can just talk about what the ‘real’ pilots did. 
The characters are not always the humans (often they are the ciphers) - it is whatever is at the centre of the action, (gormenghast etc.), whatever is occupying your time and the “point” of the activity.

“Little point to trying to make a ‘thinking machine’ more human by dressing it up in such artificial flesh’ - I disagree, Alan! Though I agree that we ehave to pretend its real rather than trying to hide it.

Laurel - characters are more limited by AI
This is why games such as these are so good - they focus on the real characters of those systems, of those times and eras.

As videogames are partially tools (Bogost) can talk about car manuals and the like as well.

He believes that games are *just* entertainment, whereas religion is for making you live better - not true! Religion began as entertaining, dramatic, mysterious.

Games can be a way of practicing religion, and certainly can simulate the act of practicing religion, if not the stories of religion themselves.

“Approaches based on human behaviour or human though… [are less] … amenable to scientific development”

“Such discomfort is hardly felt by just Hindus. Video games are, by classical definition, a vulgar work. They appeal to a mob. They're a worldly pleasure. I'd no more expect to see Jesus or Muhammad or John the Baptist in a video game offered for mainstream consumption than I would in a comic book, and I'd distrust any example I found of either as a hackneyed, tone deaf missionary text. Sure, Jesus may have appeared in comics, but their purpose was not to entertain.
And that's where you hit the fundamental incompatibility. Games and religion are unsuitable for one another because of that value: Entertainment. It's not to say games can never have a redeeming message. It's not to say a faith has no thrilling tales to tell. But one's purpose is supposed to make you live better, while the other's purpose is to make life better, without putting too fine a point on it.
There is then, perhaps, a natural and necessary separation of church and games. And I would say &quot;Render into games the things which are of games,&quot; And unto God, well, it's best to let Him render those things.”
What does it mean to engage in ritual alone? If, as Janet Murray says, “games are ritual actions allowing us to symbolically enact the patterns that give meaning to our lives,” how do solitary rituals create meaning without the social aspects that so often define our lives (Hamlet on the Holodeck, 1997)? Perhaps these solitary rituals must necessarily be acts of self-reflection or even confrontation. Trekking through Journey alone, I started to explore my own approach to the game and to my sudden sense of loss. More than ever, Journey became a ritual experience.
Interesting how few games incorporate religion, especially as playing them is so like the religious act.

“Why is it we can pray to the divine, read of them in literature, even see them in film, but not meet them in a video game?”

Novels, as we’re often told, were once deemed frivolous, much in the way that video games are now. “Video games are bad for you?” Miyamoto once said. “That’s what they said about rock and roll!” Certainly, video games have their highbrow evangelists and critical apologists, who may consider them to be cultural artifacts, coded texts, mythopoetic fictions, or political paradigms

The best analogue for their combined disreputability and ubiquity may be masturbation.

What amazes me is how much we personally identify with heroes, that that identification actually exists at all. Identification is this mysterious ability people have to live inside the thoughts, feelings, and actions of others. It's what allows people to dream the fictive dream. This identification with the hero somehow unites the gameplayer with the hero, and they somehow become one.

&quot;What is a character in a dynamic interactive digital environment vs. more traditional static artforms?&quot;
Examples of characters in games


Several examples of deficiency (and of success) in characterisation.

In computational art, particularly in the form of videogames, there are many characters that do not fulfil
the quality of 'resonance'. Indeed, it seems that there is something inherent to the artform that makes achieving
'resonance' especially difficult, particularly in balancing artistic nuance with the design demands of the dynamic
system, and characters as elements within that system. While a balance is important, I believe that autocosmic
complexity is more important to 'resonant' computational characters than algorithmic complexity. In seeking
models for such complexity, I look both to the arts and wider human culture and experience; our autocosmic
tendency augments and changes our interactions with the everyday world, at work, at play and in our idle
moments, and I believe that many of these examples can provide novel models for developing autocosmic
relations with computational art.

Different ways of creating characters on a computer.

&quot;disappointing characters in digital art - why? how do we avoid this?&quot;

Viewing games as appliances - tools to be operated - a question of design, not artistry. Why can’t tools say something, as artefacts, about humans? Why can’t they be evocative? They can, but need to think of them as artistic, and of ourselves as artists.

Part of a childhood dream, people like her very much. 
The environment is designed for her.
Always a mount (in more modern games) - the king of the red lions (boat) and spoonbill in skyward sword - is her replacement.
Horses are companions and tools - work as characters in videogames. Like a train - you build familiarity through relationship, but also the ‘alien familiarity’ of the horse - it looks weird, when you think about it, but you understand intrinsically.
You talk to it - a synaesthetic relationship; your button presses both move the horse and cause your character to touch it - people talking about horses being an extension of them (centaurs, chimera character) in games- an extension of you, or of the landscape. Relating to the landscape. Colours complementing, can already jump fences.

Deleuze and Gautari’s ‘rhizome’ structure; diffuse, unstructured
A Thousand Plateaus they
describe it with reference to a number of
characteristic ‘principles’, including con-
nection, heterogeneity, multiplicity and
rupture.
Relate to environment…
Rhizomatic thought is anti-systematic - but not anti-systemic/cybernetic?
Instead, it proceeds by way of leaps
between different, seemingly incommen-
surable, parts of the system; it is chaotic
and metamorphic, forging temporary
links between different languages and
different categories only for them to dis-
integrate as new pathways are mapped
and new connections forged. Above all,
the rhizome is always and everywhere
opposed to binary thought which, even
when it opposes the Multiple to the One,
is still mortgaged to the One – which is to
say, to an ordered, hierarchical model of
reality in which everything is (and can
only ever be) itself.
With its incalculable army of users
deploying the technology to communicate
in a seemingly endless variety of official
and unofficial ways, some have claimed
that the Internet is the rhizomatic system
par excellence.
Guatari saw the book as rhizomatic - difficult - also, computer systems, though dispersed, are highly structured - and we seek to restructure in our minds through autocosmics.
Fumito Ueda Ueda: First, with Ico, we lead with the visual aspects and it lead to a title from there. With Shadow of the Colossus, we started with the climbing mechanic, climbing on the backs of the colossi. WhenShadow of the Colossus was released, I initially thought that the important relationships in the game were the man, the woman, and the colossi. But many players actually were strongly involved with the horse; they felt that relationship was a very powerful relationship in the game.
She calls Weizenbaum a “literary artist in the computer medium”.

“Starting in the 1970s, computers have become cheaper, faster, more capacious, and more connected to one another at exponential rates of improvemen.

“We often assume that stories told in one medium are intrinsically inferior to those told in another”
“Narrative beauty is independent of medium.”
“The real literary hierarchy is not of medium but of meaning.”
PARRY as an accepted paranoid.

“Beyond… compelling entertainment to attain the force and originality that we associate with art?” - really, then, we are talking about high art.

ELIZA as “a work of electronic fiction”

&quot;Such modest incunabular creatures may seem hopelessly far from what we can achieve with Forster's &quot;word-masses&quot;, but they are nonetheless part of the same effort at understanding what it means to be human&quot;

Characters in the Sims games appeared to have real lives – they visited each other’s houses, they had jobs, they made friends and fell out. But Evans was not satisfied. “We all thought this was cool,” he says. “But the sense of realism melted away.” An occasional unrealistic action would destroy the whole illusion. For example, a sim visiting another’s house might suddenly get up and run itself a bath. Or a sim hosting a party might refuse to open its door to guests. These were not bugs in the code, says Evans. Rather, the sims did not always understand what was expected of them. They were simulations of people, but there was a lot missing.
’ve always been of the opinion that computers are not just for doing complicated calculations that would be hard for humans to do. I’ve always wanted to use computers to create new worlds and new characters and new experiences. I think, over these past many years, leading up to today, we’ve reached the point where computers can do that and we are doing that. That’s been something that I’ve felt going through these years.

“any work charac-

In a recent interview with Buddhist Geeks, designer Michaël Harboun discusses contemplative design and mentions how the medium is beginning to outgrow the term “video game.” “I consider video games as being product, not as being rudimentary video game,” he states. “I don’t like the video game anymore. I would just like to call them ‘experiences.'”

7) Borrow Intelligence from The Designers
Looking at things pragmatically, the role of the team is to build a system that shows signs of intelligence. The best strategy for that is to find the right balance between human supervision and technology. As Chris &amp; Jaime said [1]:
“Ideally you want to borrow the intelligence of the designers to make the AI seem smart, but you want to use the generalization of code to make the intelligence procedural (you can’t ship a designer on a CD).”

Nominal definitions are defined by name, defined ourselves.
He confines himself to visual media - why do I want to capture all art using computation. 
It relates to my interest in character in a general.
His use of “entertainment” is troubling, not because of snobbery but because not all art is “entertaining”. “Diverting” is closer, but that too has some insinuations. M
“Game” implies competition, “entertainment” implies “relaxation and enjouyment”
An artifact is different from art - art is the process of making artifacts, an audience-led experience of an artifact. An artifact can become art through co-option.
Computational art must have a system underlying it, a functional one, an authored one. Does not have to be explicit to the audience, but must be bound by the cybernetic nature of a computer.
The simulations are realistic enough to be used for real-world role-playing, says Evans, who presented the work last month at the Games and Media Event at Imperial College London. For example, soldiers could use such a system to practise interactions with civilians in a war zone, or young people could practise confronting bullies. “Seeing these things from multiple perspectives helps you to understand,” says Evans. (New Scientist Article)

hat they truly have desires?
In contrast? the ?ghting characters of current video games show almost no reaction
to the tremendous violence that engulfs them? Such showing of reaction is a key to
making characters b elievable and engaging? which is p erhaps why these characters
engender no concern ? they are merely abstract symb ols of action?

Re. Halo Let’s face it, the games industry uses artificial intelligence technology only to help entertain the player. It’s not about pure logical reasoning, as Chris Butcher and Jaime Griesemer (designers at Bungie on the Haloseries) commented at the start of their GDC 2002 presentation [1]:
“If you’re looking for tips about how to make the enemies in your game intelligent, we don’t have any for you we don’t know how to do that, but it sounds really hard.”

But its not an illusion of intelligence, Leon says -&gt; it is a form of intelligence. 


Weiz - difference between performance and simulation of intelligence


Bogost - style in games is more important than outcomes or plot.
Autocosmics is weak AI approach
Early AI, RACTER (artificially insane), they “sometimes manage to give the flavor” of a conversation.
Game AI is different from ‘true’ AI - just pathfinding and a set of behaviours
“A good amount of game AI developers see their craft as outside of general AI.”
Game AI is about a “tightly controlled, authored experience” - acting rather than life.
Dave Mark says it should be “artificial behaviour” rather than “artificial intelligence”
Togelius - “mutual ignorance and distrust” between the fields.
“Tricks the player into thinking that elements of the game are making informed, intelligent decisions
Role is now “aggressive machine learning (rather than hand-encoding of knowledge”
Warren Spector - “a variety of places where we could make some strides… the biggest one, for me, is more robust characters and character AI. We’ve gotten very good at combat AI, we’ve made some great strides there, but I don’t think we’ve done much in the world of non-combat AI and interacting with people - human or otherwise. We haven’t done a lot with conversation, and establishing emotional relationships with characters in games.”
“Empowering players to tell their own stories”
Bogost (11) - “games are so tightly coupled to consumer electronics that technical progress outstrips aestehtic progress in the public imagination.”
“In the mainstream space I really haven’t seen a whole lot of progress.”

 omniscient char-
acters, or characters whose knowledge of the world remains
constant even as they witness remarkable in-game events.
Because games have not featured actual knowledge propa-
gation, we often encounter the troublesome case of charac-
ters in one area of the game world appearing cognizant of
the player’s behavior in another area before word of it could
have ever spread to them

dge reasoning in the form of NPC sensors for (realisti-
cally imperfect) detection of, e.g., enemy positions. Rep-
utation systems or faction systems that alter NPC behav-
ior toward the player character according to actions she
has taken are a form of character knowledge representa-
tion, but one in which NPCs seem to globally inherit per-
fect knowledge of player behavior. Black and White’s “crea-
tures” were special NPCs that could acquire knowledge (by
reinforcement learning) about how to do certain tasks (Li-
onhead Studios 2014). Interestingly for a mainstream title,
the recent Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor features NPC
enemies who may reference earlier combat (Monolith Pro-
ductions 2014). More commonly, games may utilize simple

Roger Giner-Sorolla - Crimes against mimesis - anything that breaks the illusion of the world you have entered.
Object Out Of Context - chainsaw on the table - puzzles taking precedence over the fiction. “Screaming red flags”

While the atmosphere common to these games and their descendants has a rambling, Munchhausenish charm, it leaves much to be desired in the way of fictional coherence.

We can’t always rely on puzzles, gamey elements for our characterisation.
Apparently, pressures towards fictional unity exist even in a patently absurdist dungeon-style game.

A game is not mimesis in the simulatory or imitatory sense; it requires a pretense.

Computer interactive-fiction games also refer to characters programmed by the game's author as &quot;NPC's&quot;. In a comparison between the two kinds of game, though, the live referee has a rather unfair advantage over the programmer. The game-master bases NPC output on a highly sophisticated interactive algorithm synthesizing years of social observation and literary convention: the human mind. To even begin to compete, the computer-game author must effectively write this algorithm from scratch; an impossible task, even for the artificial-intelligence experts!

Amazingly, when examined closely, memorable characters in IF are really doing much the same things that their more forgettable counterparts are doing -- roaming about the map, reacting to single words, serving as puzzles to be overcome by the right object or objects to overcome the right puzzle. Few works of linear fiction can entirely dispense with non-protagonist characters; even Jack London's classic solo adventure story, &quot;To Build A Fire&quot;, included a canine character with at least as much personality as the hapless human hero. So, if our goal is to write IF that is good fiction as well as a good game, it's essential to make characters come alive -- preferably, without resorting to advanced artifical intelligence programming!

The beauty of the NPC illusion is that, when well-done, it can hide enormous limitations in the interactivity of the character.
Are there workable models for more complex and responsive NPC's? While it's unreasonable to expect an intelligence like 2001's HAL to emerge from a 400 kilobyte game, I think that the increasing desire of authors to create interactive games with literary elements may result in games where the NPC, instead of being a mere accessory to a lock-and-key puzzle (&quot;Hercules, lift stone&quot;;&quot;give mouse to cat&quot;), actually is the puzzle

Talks about Calkins character as a psychological maze - different rooms for different moods.
Giner-Sorolla makes his own NPC in this vein - KIM.
“Mood maze”

I’m not talking about PCs, but rather NPCs. This narrows it down a bit.

“Inconsistency of personality” is better to get people to identify. This can be hard to do in a pattern-matching medium.

Have to get the creature to do what you want by acting like the story protagonist, rather than the ‘game protagonist’ who will just poke and prod and treat like an appliance! (game and story protagonist is an idea of Giner Sorolla)
Giner-Sorolla talks a lot about overcoming the ‘gaming’ mentality of the player.

The model of a manual being the control scheme/story means that the reader of the manual is not confounded with the protagonist; the game, in essence, is separate from the story. The interaction is separated from the story, the protagonist being a guide to your own interactions. The creature and the book are your links back to the real ‘story’, which is the story of Anne. Though your story with the creature, and how you treat it, and how that relates to Anne’s treatment of it, is also important.
Giner-Sorolla’s layers of fracture of a protagonist.

Aligning the player’s actions and desires with the desired narrative of the game. 

Waypoint (vice) talks about why character is so difficult - what must be built - the representation is so hard - so put the representation in people’s heads as much as possible.

Video games won't be the perfect, twenty-dimensional vision imagined in a creative person's head. There are realistic limitations to what can be translated from that imagination into a playable experience, dependent on the limitations of technology, and the structure of video game development. And yet we've still had many opportunities to play games that were representations of a studio's best ideas, however cut and culled they may have been.
Thomas was alone - projection of personality onto blocks through suggestion.
Post-hoc rationalisation
Going through our own computation of inferences to choose one that fits with suggestion. 
Disliking each other then explore that through interpretation of mechanics. 

For example, the original idea of the Creatures was that a player could choose to make any living thing a Creature. We wanted the player to be able to select an ant and grow that, or a human being from a tribe, and raise him or her. Christian Bravery, one of the artists, spent a long time drawing concept work and sketches depicting what the Creatures could look like at various stages of their development. This of course included humans.
We soon realized that people would have certain expectations from a human. Players wouldn't expect a turtle to learn as quickly as a man, but if we dumbed down the people, they'd seem like a proto-hominid race from eons ago, and we didn't want that. Also, discipline in the game involves slapping your Creature. We certainly couldn't have the player slapping a child or a woman or, really, even a grown man. The emotional feel of raising a human, teaching him or her to eat what you want, and leading him or her around in a speechless environment was all wrong.

The reason we cannot do characters in AI is because AI finds ordinary human things very difficult to do - and ordinary relatable behaviour is what we crave in characters - “the literary”.
It’s a shame if we narrowly limit the definition of video games,” he said. Miyamoto (New Yorker)

“Anything that is impractical can be play,” Miyamoto said. “It’s doing something other than what is necessary to continue living as an animal.”

Believable agents (loyall 1997) the Hap architecture
 Believable agents allow people to not just watch,
but also interact with such powerful, personality-rich characters.

 You might choose to walk into Rick’s Café Américain from Casablanca and invite
Rick to join you for a drink, knowing all along that he might refuse, but enjoying the
interaction all the same

Believable agents are personality-rich autonomous agents with the powerful properties
of characters from the arts

 a character
is considered believableif it allows theaudienceto suspend their disbelief and if it provides
a convincing portrayal of the personality they expect or come to expect

 This goal is different from the bulk of
autonomous agent work in that the focus is on building agents that have distinct, specific
Personalities

 This
difficulty is shared by two areas of the arts, literature and animation, in that the illusion
of life and personality must be constructed from simple components such as words or line

Theauthorofabelievable
agent cannot control or know with certainty the situations the agent will encounter. In a
linear story, the author can bring all of his or her humanity to bear to decide how the
character reacts to each situation in turn. For abelievable agent some version of a“whole” 1
personality must be created. This agent must react to situations as they arise without being
able to draw directly on the wealth of its creator’s knowledge.

from reality, retaining only those elements of realism that contribute to conveying the

What is a character is too large for thesis.

Incunabula - our early attempts now.  - we need to do something though - we cannot rely on teleology alone.


Coding as “a magical method for creating anything on earth out of ordinary English words” - making the autocosmic manifest, rather than implicit as with literature. This has not really been achieved in many arenas.

Papert believed that computers were “tools for thinking” (p9)

“Increasingly visceral representational technologies”

I do think that the fear of digital technology is because of a lack of naturalisation. “Eventually, all successful storytelling technologies become ‘transparent’” - like the novel.


P28 - we cannot use old ways of judgement to judge a fundamentally new medium. We can, to some degree, because it excites similar things.
“Cleverness of rules” - cleverness meaning courting human psychology, not necessarily computing power. Not the best kit, necessarily.

“Participation in an immersive environment has to be carefully structured and constrained.”
“It is easier to create a dictional personality than it is to model knowledge of the world.” Dramatic behaviour,  not realistic behaviour. 
“Perhaps the VR medium of the future will largely support a literature of nostalgia, full of shimmering visions of the preindustrial past.”

Sklar doesn’t address this, but making characters interactive, what would that do?
“Agency is the satosfying power to take meaningful action and see the results of our decisions and choices.

What are ppl interested in? Aren't AAA more for the technologists than anything else?
&quot;It remains to be seen whether we can capture the illusion of &quot;the incalculability of life&quot; with the emotional calculus of the computer. In the meantime, the most pleasurably surprising interactive characters may be those who are created with considerably less programming.&quot;

“We tend to associate lack of variation with machines”.

&quot;part of the task of redefining what it means to be human lies in animating the machibne, in using its system-modelling abilities to bring forth life - cuddly, affectionate, amusing and recognisable - from empty matter.

Flying scotsman - soul, power animal/totem - train itself, what it allows people to do, and focus for self-devotion, like to think of it as separate from the petty concersn of man.

Mechanical reasoning vs. brain simulation - former is mechanical, logical, step-by-step, symbolic, the latter is intuition, soft computing, guesswork, heurisitcs - but can we not simulate the latter? Is that not the role of art? Isn't that what we do with books?


Play is not the opposite of serious, it has its own seriousness.

“Working through” feelings - do adults do this, as well? Why read fiction?
Re ELIZA (sherry turkle rafael behr” - “instead of exposing the program’s weakness, everyone pandered to its strengths.”

Is what I am doing affective computing - can recognise, interpret, process and simulate human emotion 
I am saying keep the emotion out of the computer? Just have the computer affect emotion without systematising it.
Artists can bring a lot to computers.

Does affective computing have a place in art. Yes, if it makes the computer work better, rather than the art.
Very data-dependent - what generates that data? Requires observation of how people behave. Artists have been trying to do this for millenia.
“Irrespective of the future of machine intelligence, computers are affecting how today’s children think.”

‘Marginal’ objects are ritual objects - we can try things out with them - play as serious. Characters as ‘marginal’ beings.

Talk about my feelings arising through watching Studio Ghibli films.
Games provide us with a model for real-world complex systems. This creature is a complex system. What does it tell you about religion - learn something about ourselves.
Computers are “objects-to-think-with”
The computer is not really special, it is just another way to think about ourselves.
Games do use the tool paradigm - but there are other, more interesting operatees in human culture that we can look to.
Religion in design - court the naivety or folkiness of audience - “if you can’t put knowledge on the device, then develop a cultural constraint: standardise what has to be kept in the head.” This model is the problem.
Play is not moralistic or ethical - nothing is out-of-bounds -&gt; it must remain outside the real ethical implications of real life.

Books are evocative objects too, but they have been normalised to a certain extent.

The tongues are controlled like snakes, the lips are like latches - but still some attempt to overcome these issues, to say something.
One character can push the other back.
Can lick the other person’s eye - they close it in response - or their nose - the ridiculousness of this simulation.

Depression Quest/Rainy Day - constraining narrative for character reasons (depression) - reneging on the system. This is good, but not all games can be about paralysis/lack of choice. How late are you going to be to work?
Navigating through options, amongst the anxiety (this is also character as environment, as traversal, diegetic)
Clouded thoughts navigates you - stuck in circular thoughts (the unclouded ones)

The sets of actions and per-
ceptions are defined by the video game - tence and buche

Samyn believes that we do not even need to feel emotions, just perform them. But we do need to believe in them, in the way that we believe in all fictive characters, while we are making them, and apply the believed metaphor to all we make. 

Piaget - play strengthens and alters our perception of how the world works.

“Expressing is more important than capturing”

Re. Cheongsam - “virtual theratre”, improv with AI, reacts in subtle ways, “games are performatives. 
Joshua  Tanenbaum - videogames = method acting
Versu as theatre - very interesting - genre files specify baseline behaviours, story files present premises, situations, provocations, locations, roles - roles are projected onto characters, and character files hold hopes, traits, preferences etc. 
Jocelyn Spence - performative experience design - “because audience matters”
Performative Experience Design - related to Brenda Laurel’s work, but more focussed on user in performance of HCI. The “performer-spectator dyad”. “Tools for conceptualising the representation of action.” “Performance roles in different interactional dynamics between human and computer agents.”
Dalsgaard and Hensen - 3x roles in one user - operator, performer and self-spectator. “It is precisely this awareness of the (potentiality of a) spectator that transforms the user into a performer.”
Being anxious is a serious matter. This game aims to illustrate how anxiety can get into the way of a happy life. 
Brenda Laurel and her book Computers as Theatre is my touchstone for this; in this book, she advocates for seeing the user/computer relationship as like a performer/audience relationship, as a “representation on stage”, in many different ways, and that through the application of techniques of performance (in her case, theatrical performance) better applications and systems will be developed.

 For her, “the interface becomes the arena for the performance of some task in which both human and computer have a role”. This performance relies on a sense of ‘naive physics’ in the average user. That user will not fully understand how a computer works, and therefore must be provided with ways to support their (flawed) conception of the system in its usage; if they think a computer works in this way, make it seem as if it does when they use it. This way, they will be less frustrated. As in theatre, there will be “nothing between the audience and the stage [or functionality] but some good illusion.” For Laurel, unless we are engineers of a particular machine we should never interact with a system directly, but rather a representation of it; a fictionalised interface which represents its internal workings partially. Indeed, more important than functioning, hermetic systems and features is the feeling that you are interacting with a fully-reactive system.
This comes from the idea that even though we are designing systems and artefacts, no system means anything without a user. The human being is an “indisputable ingredient of the representation”. A computer, like a drama, must have an audience to matter; a “computer-based representation without a human participant” is like the proverbial tree in a forest that nobody is around to hear. Laurel’s ideas stand closely with modern design ideas, as advocated by Donald Norman in the Design Of Everyday Things, which advises removing ambiguity, prizing affordance and visibility and creating pleasurable interactions through respect for human psychology. As in theatre, “all that matter[s]”, with a computer program, “is that which is illuminated”; where we draw attention, create drama, tension, flow, harmony, context etc. Influences the reality of that program in the mind of the user. We must avoid the ‘boring’, useless parts of computing, that hold no interest for the user, and create a pleasurable series of peaks and troughs while prizing the inherent use of the program. Interfaces are often clunky, heteroarchical and a barrier to the functionality underneath. 
Through this, we open normally-staid, functional programs (and dramatic programs such as videogames, a field in which her book has been used extensively) to providing the sorts of experiences that we do not usually associate with complex systems; “the possibility of surprise and delight”, negative experiences perceived positiviely because of the vicarious sense of drama, of unreality and ‘playing’, at their heart, the drama which are at the heart of unpredictable plans in intelligent systems, graceful beginning and endings of interactions that relate to each other thematically.
Therefore, the assets, environment and objects of a system, while important, are not imperative; action is, however. Though both drama and computing are ‘pan-sensory representations’ of a reality, a drama cannot be acted in by the audience. The ‘user’ of a computer program is both audience and actor within a joint performance; for like art, people need audiences too, even if that audience is merely a reactive program. Everybody wants to feel important, to feel as if they are participating in something grave, in a ritual with importance. 

Interesting - Oatley talks about the lack of imagination needed in thrillers or theme park rides - you are the same person when you get off at the other end. - “mount[ing] a vehicle” or “package vacation” - “one can have ana bsorbing time, but such experiences can be meager of agency”
Hilgard - “transportation… may be too passive” (in Oatley)
“Games are in many ways like stories. They are primarily about agency, and they thereby illuminate the nature of fiction. Every game offers the agent who enters it a goal, some outline plans, and a set of appratus, constraints and rules that must be followed”
“Although games may not be serious, this element of enactment occurs both in fiction and in games, and it can be serious… the self may be transformed”

“Games are those kinds of stylized encounters in which…we may expect to have emotional experiences that will ve fun”
“Games… contain enactmnets of roles that the encvounter afford”

Look at the qualitative effects of games.

‘Non-linear’ is not necessarily the word we are looking for.

Game characters, as opposed to traditional characters, are currently at the heart of my enquiry, so I must look at game design, play theory and digital narrative techniques to understand the differences and similarities between the two forms.

A game arises in meaningful play within an interactive system by a player or players.

&quot;A game is from the player's point of view. A player is playing a game when they are engaging in critical thinking about the interactive decisions they are making with regard to the system they are engaging with.&quot;


Homo Ludens

Johan Huizinga is probably my best source for comparing interactive software systems with both performance, religion and gameplay, all in one lovely, crunch package.

Below are several quotes from Homo Ludens:

“Holiness and play always tend to overlap.”
“Myth and ritual… are rooted in the primeval soil of play.”
“All true ritual is sung, danced and played.” (p.158)
&quot;In all its higher forms the latter at any rate always belongs to the sphere of festival and ritual - the sacred sphere&quot;

Huizinga, in his anthropological study of play, brings in this idea of severity, or rather seriousness. He states that the modern belief that play is a frivolous, superfluous activity is misguided and stagnant; that play has always at its heart a meaning, and that meaning is often extremely serious (which is not the same as grave, unhumoured or boring). This meaning has, he admits, been obfuscated by the desacralisation of play as we moved away from ‘primitive’ religion. His opinions in this regard are a little dated

&quot;the experience of the most formidable seriousness is accomplished in the form of play&quot;

“rules of a game are absolutely binding and allow no doubt&quot; - what are the rules of the creature? Ogf religion. And of books as well. 

It is quite obvious to me that the creature’s religion, and the rituals that the manual describes, are a form of play; they serve themselves and itself, and are a space in which paracosms are created. See the Paracosm section for more of this from Huizinga.

Re. Laurel - “people seemed to regard interactivity as the unique cultural discovery of the electronic age” - not true, of course.

Koster -&gt; Behaviour in games meets needs unmet elsewhere

WHY are people coming to the work - people come to games with goals - do I provide them 
Tension with players wanting to chunk and you wanting to simulate.



Does it contain choices? Rituals do not have choices, they prescribe.

Re. Biology - turkle - “an anxiety that digital objects will take us away from the body and its ways of understanding.”

Laurel - Software “realises an environment through evocative, consistent illusions”
Laurel - “a piece of computer software is a collaborative exercize of the imagination of the creator(s) of the program and the people who use it”
Laurel - the code “an internal representation… the potential for what may be made manifest in the external representation.”
Laurel - games ‘evolved from the impact of dramatic ideas on the technology of interactive computing”
“The perception of patterns in sensory phenomena is a source of pleasure for humans - Aristotle’s melody - applies to narrative, as well - surprise as well as pattern - streamlining - chunking? Have we been maligning games for too long? Are they ritualistic

All computer programs have a form of agency - but must coalesce that into entitites - she maintains that ‘their existence is implied’ - we create an entity from the abstracts of all computing in the Aristotelian sense - good characters do what they intend to do - play with this as time goes on.

I am not trying to create a realistic creature - it is definitely an abstraction, artistically. It must be. It must respond to a small set of actions. I could go very far with the abstraction, or try to be very realistic - I should not do either. It must be both representative and symbolic, all at once.

When it comes to games, these natural gaps occur just as
frequently. Similar to film and television, games have to rely
on the player’s sense of seeing and hearing to craft a scene.
Abstract systems are often called upon to relay the missing
information to the player; there might be a meter for the
player character’s health, flashing red to visualise the pain
the player cannot feel. Often the mechanics emerge from
the correct combination of these information sources by the
player. In order to make them feel less abstract or arbitrary,
they are linked to metaphors that contribute to the story of the
game. Games are systems designed to respond to user input,
a set of rules defining which actions can be taken and what
outcome should follow - and a well-presented story can help
the player understand these rules by instinct, if the designer
understands the need for closure and where to apply it. (Staedler)

The player
as Agent is capable of expressing herself as part of a story
world or a community, because the game does not rely on
her making the correct choice in order to construct a mean-
ingful narrative. In fact, her mistakes can lead to memorable
moments that fellow players recall and share.

Player stories on the other hand emerge from less moder-
ated game play. They occur when the designer has no strict
events for the player to observe in mind and instead allows
her to explore a system that, although providing concrete
challenges and goals, is less concerned with enforcing rules
as to how the events occurring in it should be perceived

powerful player stories form from the delicate
balance of players predictic the outcome of their action and
being surprised by the right combination of partially random
factors.

 Games like The Wolf Among Us have their ma-
jor plot points laid out and will follow through with their
progression no matter what the player does - but there are
still plenty of options given to her. Their purpose is to re-
flect on the events of the story rather than to lead them. In
this perspective, &quot;The actor’s reasons for taking their actions
are predetermined by the author to lend believability to their
behaviours&quot;(Thue, Bulitko, &amp; Spetch, 2008). (Stadeler)

Wolf Among Us and things like that.

Frank Lantz in RoP - despite the breathtaking pace of recent technical and commercial advancement, games have remained creatively stunted.

RoP approach - the “aesthetics of interactive systems”

Is what I am doing a game? Drill down into this.

We don’t want to regress, with games, but perhaps we are regressing

Schell, &quot;The desire to act and all the thought and emotion that go with that are present in both&quot; digital and traditional media, and &quot;The Diﬀerence only comes at the participant’s ability to take action&quot; (Schell, 2008

Weber/McF - ‘wonder’ is a state in which we are comfortable with not knowing.

Bertrand Russell - 'The Conquest of Happiness' artificial stimulation (in our case, games) provide the body with excitement but it is false as we are sedentary. 

Extra Credits (Enriching Lives) - Geth conundrum in Mass Effect 2 - small computational remit, but the narrative remit provides the depth. 

Players want an experiences that a worthy game intends

&quot;Where there is no visible action there can be no play&quot; p.166

Games need to make people care about their subjects, and their subject’s feelings. 

Ian Bogost calls them ‘procedural media’ - establish rules and behaviours with constraints and affordance - the constraint of choice overall is meaningful, not just choice itself - ritual is constrained choice. 

EC - “a specific set of actions and reactions to the player, the designer expresses meaning, which is in turn experienced directly and personally by the player”

What about self-expression within a defined possibility space? Self-expression within religion?

Share the character’s “emotional landscape”

Where is the granularity and where is the generality?

Artistic agency in your smaller choices.

‘Player Story’ There is a 'reader story' in books, as well


&quot;lyrical expression is the farthest removed from logic and comes closest to music and dance&quot; 

Does play have to be physical? Huizinga could not have predicted the rise of the virtual, of the interface, of HCI.

&quot;Systemisation and regimentation of sport... something of the pure play-quality is inevitably lost&quot; - applies elsewhere, as well, to games etc.? &quot;Sterile&quot; now. No more ritual tie. Not art.

“Best part of this dog? He doesn’t die?” Animals seen in terms of utility

Games are not a self-contained logical system - they involve human psychology games are a form of play that is tied to logic (i.e. the computer) - this is a tension because true play must be illogical. How can I get past this?
tension between magic and instructions

&quot;the epic severs its connection with play as soon as it is no longer meant to be recited on some festal occasion but only to be read&quot;.

All play means something - ritual that has importance. &quot;there is some sense to it... transcends the immediate needs of life and imparts meaning to the action&quot; p.1

ELO ‘confrontation with technology at the level of creation’

Games' 'chanceful character' is important to their value - cosmic significance of chance.

Smoothness is what is missing in games - the transition between elements being so complex, they judder into one another

Game character is best without personaloty - you can put it in yourself.

Challenge?

Chris Crawford (Siboot) - essentialise conversation in real-time (I don’t think it works)

These ideas of realism and freedom in games do not correspond to drama - need more limitation (Re. Laurel)

The complaint of ‘lack of choice’ in many games is actually more about lack of step-by-step (I.e. instantaneous) choice.

Garrard - we often look through, not at, machines.

We are subconsciously tuned to how things are supposed to work at a cognitive level - a problem for game designers

The idea of god games - all games are god games.
Black and White - keeping track of what your creature believes.

Training tips for creature - an instruction manual. 
Comfort him after he has been cruing - chunking the emotional model. 
“One creature I know will only poo next to a rock that he just threw over his shoulder.”
“Some people slap their creatures after they have fully rested, as a way of teaching them not to sleep in. I consider this to be cruel and unusual punishment.”
“Relax! Be yourself, and let your creature do what comes naturally.. Remember that you are just a minor God; the definitions of good and evil are absolute and not up to you.”

“The most terrible warrior I have heard of is a creature named Burn. Because he likes to burn things. At the moment he relieves himself on the corpse of his slain foes. Horrible.” 

The virtual friend needs to have its own life, away from the player - does this also happen in literature - 'book time' and 'computer time'

Most interactive widgets dump the user in a sandbox and say &quot;figure it out for yourself&quot;. Those are not explanations. To me, an essential aspect of the &quot;explorable explanation&quot; concept is that the author holds up his end of the conversation. The author must guide the reader, and provide a structure for the learning experience. Only then can the reader respond, by asking and answering the questions that the author provokes.

we &quot;must move outside the limitations of the intellect.&quot;

he reader is not forced to interact in order to learn. The reader interacts if he wants to go deeper, if he has piqued curiosity or unanswered questions. There are no UI elements screaming for attention. The reader is not transported off to a separate &quot;interactive&quot; context. Instead, the reader simply nudges the examples that the author has already presented.

Re. Laurel and performance - my audience is both passive and active - more like a religious service?

Leigh Alexander - bring back linear, written narratives -&gt; writers need to be part of design team


Games create order, simplify a domain, require consensus for it not to be 'spoiled'.
The difference between an artist and a designer. A designer curates an environment in which an experience can take place. 

“Games sired by these new technologies emphasize tech aspects over dramatic themes”

Awe and unknowing -&gt; we are trapped inside our empowerments -&gt; as in games, we are always trying to exert the power that games give us, usually against others. Reverse it, the creature has power - it can wink you out of existence by turning the program off itself!

E-Lit course - oour barriers to understanding begin with the device, unlike books! Therefore must be entirely non-diegetic.

Mattie Brice -&gt; gamers need to be made uncomfortable.
Heidegger &amp; ‘bestand’ - same with technology -&gt; just ‘ready’ to be used? Everything is there to serve us. Harrison’s ‘reduction to utility’.

Explicit stories versus player stories - should be indistinguishable.

How much do I go with the gamer paradigm? I want anybody to be able to interact with this.

Issue of complexity (re. TWD and Venturbeat) - “the more variables are added and tracked, the more difficult it becomes to give choices the weight they deserve.”

In Mass Effecct - big choices are set up and then negated or rendered meaningless with hardly any context.

TWD &amp; Illusion of choice - “quite adamant” that choices are meaningful, and even though not they feel as if they have the ‘potential’ to be meaningful -&gt; through reference to past actions.

If you look for choice, you are ‘robbing yourself of the illusion’.
The dialogie between you and game matter because they affect how you react, no just the game. 
“If the ending is the be all, end all for you, you may walk away upset”
It’s “tailored”, not unite. 
Plot points and character points are authored, but you decide points in between. 
“Power over plot seems limited” - ontological geek. (refs David Cage’s technique of slight narrative variation within authorship, which changes the prism through which you view authored events.”
New Gamer Nation - “the medium of videogaming is one that allows for the audience (player) to influence the story of the medium juristicially” - UHUH, nope.
“All of the choices in Telltale games have emotional change” - is it always a good, effective change, though?

CRIT - Telltale games set an ‘obvious expectation’ for meaningful choices which is then let down - this is partly marketing - maybe we should talk less mechanistically about this stuff. 
“Telltale bombards the player with suggestive text that affirms the specialness of its product. 

Telltale Games ‘statistics’ - a bit clumsy - let those smaller moments stand anecdotally rather than systematising them. 
Perhaps these games contribute to an overegging or overemphasis of the role of decision and choice. 

We have an expectation to make ‘black box choices’ - to have a chaos effect through touching something that later on makes all the dominoes fall. This is a narrative fallacy and chilche. Actually, most of our decisions just affect us there in the mment. 

“It shouldn’t all boil down to endings.”

“To consider a choice valuable solely on how it can affect outcomes, rather than its own merit, is a value judgement I find… lacking.”

Stop giving so much explicit feedback - obfuscate the feedbaclk.

Is it hero syndrome to want to affect the story so utterly?

He thinks the past is more playgful - not any more, I would say! We live in a saturated magic-circle age

We have a childish view of cause and effect - let me see what I did, so that I can feel visceral and important.

Telltale is mostly around talking - but no talking in mine

Schafer - A plot (action plot) B plot (emotional plot) - b plot is often no resolved.

Re. TWAU - do I “play along” with the fiction, or ty to express myself against it.

TWAU is very stilted between speech units - modularity works, but can have odd transitions - this is what a POSH plan is for, but requires narrative tweening. 

Our brains can’t keep track of all the options, so we can’t ‘chunk’ the game structure.

Game design is, by its very nature, mercenary - it means different things to different people, provides different solutions to different problems, no right answer - useful to everyone.

Air Time Game  - an example of a vignette, a feeling, wish fulfillment and childish abandon with pretzels - cozy, quiet, dark
Small interactions - a personal opinions.
Can’t get out -&gt; limitations of game correspond to real life.
Brian Eno - artists “become gardneners rather than architects”
“A flight so comfortable” you’ll wish it was longer.”

Salen and zimmerman - games as: rules, information manipulator, sensation of play, core mechanics, feedback loops, embedded vs. Emergent narrative, player roles, pressures.
“We know what constitutes a game; we know how they work, why they matter, and the kinds of experiences they are capable of producing… but we have barely tested the limits of what they have the potential to become.

Experience of play “defies normal dexcription”
The different layers of meaning behind play - social, mechanical, digital.
Tie the idea of paracosmics in play with idea of meaningful play
Play doe not come just from game, but from the player’s interactions with the game’s systems, and the context in which it is played. Interaction is based on choices and actions from these choices.
“They even have to make a choice whether or not to play.”
Global vs. Local consequences.
“Every action taken results in a change affecting the overall system of the game… an action a player takes in a game results in the creation of new meanings within the system”
Relationships change
Either discernible or intergated changes, either intrinsic or extrinsic meaning. Discernible means direct feedback from action in the moment, intergrated means how that action will affect later experiences within the game. 
Games = meaningful play at all levels of the game (rules, the play itself, the game’s context) through the design of interactive systems with which the player interacts and produces responsive outcomes. The meaning exists in that relationship between interaction and outcome. 

“Design is the process by which a designer creates context to be encountered by a participant, from which meaning emerges.”
A game is a “system fo meaning” - related to me wanting to make signs all the ay down, even to those parts that the public won’t see, because I am a human being and it helps me.”

Semiotics relates to our ability to understand that signs represent. “Smoke represents the concept of ‘fire’… the tallest piece in chess denotes the ‘King’.
Games are not just mechnical constraints, but semiotic constraints as well - affordances.
We go through life looking for meaning, and so design must have meaning for us. 
Meaning is made from signs/semiotics.
Ordinary things become meaningful in a system. 
“The signs that make up the game world collectively rperesent the world to the player… althrough the signs certainly make reference to objects that exist in the real world, they gain their symbolic value or meaning from the relationship between signs in the game” - evocative objects, paracosmics, partiality.
Therefore semiotics permits anthropomorphism.

The Last Guardian - “this creature isn’t like the cute pets that exist in other games, or an ally that’s really useful… an experience that people have never had before.” He is, in  fact, like an environment.

Dan Solberg - empathy games - designed to “evoke a specific emotional or psychologucal response” - he is mainly talking about personal/autobiographical games, but all games are empathy games - increase our understanding on an outside perspecitve. 

Dan Solberg - “focus on player takeaways and outcomes often outweighs consideration for the artists intent”
“Sometimes superficial rewards and self-applying merit badges players win for merely sympathising”

Compulsion loops



Games say - don’t update things players can’t see!”visual intelligence” - if they don’t see it, it doesn’t happen. Make it big and clunky animations in most games Need to be able to tell what they are thinking and why they do things.”















Salen &amp; Zimmerman cont.

Signs representing something other than itself - semiotics, religion, paracosmics, representation, objects as emotive semiotic representations in the AI. 

Games-as-semiotics means systematising cultural pointers, something I’m against - this is sometimes useful in games, but not always. Esp. With videogames, games are not just systems - they are 

“Looking at chains of signifiers in a game means dissecting a game in order to view the system at a micro-level to see how the internal machinery operates”

Signs are intepreted - they require an audience, a meaning to somebody. The meaning comes when they are interpreted. S&amp;Z’s chopsticks and soup example.

Saussure - “meaning of signs are arrived at arbitrarily via cultural convention… the meaning of signs rests not in the signs themselves, but in the surrounding system”.

Religion as defining conventions, game rules and instruction manuals defining conventions.

You must stick to the game’s accepted symbols, not create your own (a ‘W’ in rock paper scissors)

A game’s grammar, its structure, its ritual, is its rules. 

Most smoogles have comcom - we don’t know what these nouns are, but we can make assertions about them - knowledge representation. Use context in knowledge representation

“The act of interpretation relies, in part, on the movement between known and unknown information”.

“The meaningful play that you provide for your players emerges from the designed system of a game - and how that game interacts with larger social and cultural systems.”

Elements coalescing through interaction into systems. 

“As systems, games provide contexts for interaction, which can be spaces, objects and behaviours that players explore, manipulate and inhabit.”

(Character as environment) - systems have objects, attributes, internal relationships and an environment. Lots of different systems at play within one larger system. Ways to frame. 

Hierarchical systems that nest in layers, interactions occurring at all scales, both between and within layers. 
Playing with scale here as in narrative and myth (huizinga)

“When you are designing a game you are not designing just a set of rules, but a set of rules that will always be experienced as play within a cultural context… you never have the luxury of forgetting about context”

Games are purposeful Rube Goldberg systems.

Bertalanffy - many different things are systems, all interconnected - political systems, cells, literature?

Difference between game characters and book characters as the difference between closed and open systems. Open systems pass and recieve “matter and energy” to its environment. 

Though always debatable whether a system is open or closed. 

Do we frame the character as an individual, as a collection of attributes and actions, as a slot in a landscape that is filled? Could the character ever be anybody else?

You are a character in its mind.

Characters in systems is hard - character as system is easier. 
“Play implies interactivity: to play with a game, a toy, a person, an idea, is to interact with it.”
If we are interacting with characters in books, what is the ‘meaningful outcome’?

Interaction must be a relationship between two things, both of which are active. Therefore characters in books are not interactive. 

Andy Cameron - “interactivity means the ability to intervene in a meaningful way within the representation itseld, not to read it differently.”

Laurel does not seem to think that you need direct intervention, just interpretative difference through interaction. 

Chris Crawford - interactivity as a conversation, back and forth. 

“None of these definitions resolve the question of whether or not all media, or even all experiences, are interactive.”

AS Weizenbaum says - “the traditional approach in AI has been to start with calculative rationality and then make compromises to reach resource constraints”.

Salen &amp; Zimmerman allow for a ‘multivalent model of interactivity’.
Cognitive interactivity - in mind. 
Functional interactivity - with basic functions of system as it is physically made and defaulted. (accidental)
Explicit interactivity - with designed systems (glitches come when explicit interacvitiy gives way to functional interactivity, but cognitive interactivity can patch it up.) (designed)
Beyond-the-object interactivity - social context

All important to developing character, for making choices in a system. 

But the representation can be in your head, therefore you are directly intervening!

S+Z say that without an explicit designed context, an action cannot have explicit meaning. I disagree. Design creates meaning, but so does accidental context. 

Micro vs. Macro choices. 

Game design as a form of concrete poetry - (Little Sparta) - “this poetry lays out on the page an images which elicits from the reader an imaginative response to the visual appearance of the words, the ideas they present and the juxtapositions of sound, shape or reference designed by the poet… combining their appearance and meanings in works to be meditated upon as, say, a sculpture may be.”
Finlay made “painted wooden ‘toys’” ‘rocking boats, strings of drying fish, windmills’ (little sparta) - drawn from his imagination, totemism. Became sculpture - “began to produce toys on a larger sail”


Choice molecules add up in a seamless flow to produce a representation. 
What happened before the choice?
How does the player know they can make a choice?
How is the choice made? 
What are the results of the choice?
How is the result coonveyed. 


Oulipo - writing as constrained, as imaginative, vindicating the constraints of gamemaking

ELO - “information technology is driven increasingly by proprietary concerns”.
The tech world is driven by aggressive utopianism tied to a commercial drive. Therefore, AI (and tech art, in many ways) rarely looks backward, only forward.

SOLUTIONS - I have no desire to track users other than locally, within the magic circle of the game itself. I have no desire to have their data; my relationship with them does not extend into the ubicomp realm (see below). I am data-blind.

Francois Le Lionnais  - “every literary work is constructed with as its starting point an inspiration…  that must adapt as best it can to a series of restrictions and procedures.” What the Oulipo intended wto show was that these restrictions are welcome, bountiful, and indeed literature itself. 
Jean Pierre Enard - multiple choice theatre “The authors emphasise the necessity of providing an illusion of repeated choices, while in fact keeping the number of available scenes manageable”.

Nuclai - “willing to borrow whatever algorithm may work”.
“Whatever gets the problem solved most efficiently”.

Game AI is not AI - it’s own thing. It’s everything that goes into a character - art, design, testing, the user itself. The user is always positioned, their experience. We try and trick them into better experiences. 

Not interested in the ludology/narratology divide - it is intellectually bankrupt.

soft chambers is bubbling excitedly about games which encourage us to set our own goals and terms of engagement rather than placing us into scenarios with clear conditions for success and failure, and hopes that such game experiences can begin to help us explore and unsettle our relationships to digital play

Ilussion of choice.

“From a ludic perspective this choice… is quasi-irrelevant. What it does to tthe player on a narrative level, however, deserves utmost credit.”

“Your decision… will be of ethical importance to yourself.”

Weizenbaum  - we are too quick to reduce experience to systems thinking - “mechanical paroudy”
But actually ideas about systems in all fields have moved on.

Peter Molyneux - I wanted the game to be more flexible, more open, and more attractive than anything I'd ever played. I was determined that the player could do almost anything he or she wanted.

EC - hide the mechanical basis for decisions.

I’m obviously not really looking at player as character here.
“Populate the virtual world with narrative elements that allow the player to make up his or her own story.” R-TAM 

What does using a computer to make characters (re. Weizenbaum) close me off to? What am I losing? If something doesn’t work well, we just say “the computer isn’t good enough yet” - but what if the problem is that computation is the wrong way to make that thing work?

Is it a weakness thinking of this as a game - in the commercial rather than structural sense - re. Mountain - is is a weakness to market it as such.

GEtting the human to care - joy in gaming is in imagining a character behind the volition, experienced emotion/

“The illusion that the opponent is more than a set of silicon circuits and unfeeling connectors.”

The gaming domain limits the scope of the problem, making it possible to use cheap mechanisms to implement a fast system that works most of the time.

Samyn (realtime art manifesto) thinks we should “claim the name ‘game’ for what we do.”

“The human player knows that the computer simply doesn’t care.”

Turkle states that movement is not always necessary anymore - how we are confront by psychological objects. “Motion theory” is not enough anymore.
“Children are now confronted with highly interactive objects that talk… play, and win.”
“Movement is not the key to the puzzle”
“As children become older and more sophisticated their arguments about the computer’s aliveness become focussed on increasingly refined psychological distinction.”
We don’t escape this childhood reasoning completely.

She compares it to playing an instrument. Games have changed an awful lot now. Now more about environments. 
“Children identify more directly with the games’ characters” - not just working on a “skill”, therefore we need to focus on children’s interactions with computers to think about character worthily, not just think about adult techniques - same with books, can use similar techniques for adults and children.

soft chambers is interested in what verbs we use - the verbs that we don't use (caring/nurturing/growing/giving/embracing/resting) are &quot;devalued activities under capitalism, they are considered feminized actions or are excluded from the category of 'action' entirely&quot;


Soft chambers see empathy games as blunt instruments, positioning empathy as a global phenomenon over universal experiences  - empathy is not the same as understanding. 

&quot;empathy is not a genre&quot;

Soft chamber's notion of harm as &quot;occuring within coommunities and locales - the religion as a community - what is harm to this creature?


“Physical simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence” - comparing to the birth of flight - we are not attempting to fly.
'Consensus A.I. - we all agree
Merritt Kopas' soft chambers is for games as tools for facilitating the giving and receiving of care
soft chambers is against the notion that the positive is always more straightforward and less interesting than the negative
soft chambers is about tenderizing games

whereas the traditional approach to 'closing distance’ has been to attempt 'immersion’ of the player within the game world, soft chambers believes it may be more fruitful to explore ways in which we can allow the game to spill into the player’s world


a major barrier to the exploration of emotional resonance in games is the puzzle-solving orientation, in which all game objects and actors are reduced to the status of things to be used in order to achieve an end

thus, soft chambers is invested in discovering ways to disrupt this orientation

one way to achieve this disruption is to reduce the gap between the player and the player character. second-person text-based games have an advantage here in that the form of address ‘you’ already confounds player and character, investing the player in her role

in robert yang’s hurt me plenty, the distance between player and character is reduced by the use of a motion sensing device. even if the game is being played without the device, the use of gestural mouse movements feels more natural and human than, for instance, pressing a button to select a dialogue choice

further, hurt me plenty allows the narrative of the game to 'spill out’ of the borders of the game experience. pushing the other character beyond his limits, ignoring his safe word, will prevent the game from being played for a set period of time

for some players, this consequence is experienced as an unfair obstruction, a restriction on a product to which they expect full access

but soft chambers is aware that this is not a simple problem of substitution

consider, for instance, the ways in which caring and communication have typically been rendered in digital games: as predictable, solvable problems

because videogames are the aesthetic form of rationalization, replacing punching with hugging or building with growing is not enough

but it is a start

empathy games reduces t reduces empathic connection to empathy tourism

soft chambers values empathy but knows that empathy is not a genre

“Believability in game characters” can be either a perceptive or a haptic sensation - (re. Tence, Buche et. Al 2010)


“[AI] has had a remarkable career as art”
Discovering means and objectives of doing things to achieve the end.

Tence &amp; Buche see learning and imitation as important to believability.

Partially “telepresence”, but also independent from the ‘player as an actor’ in the gamespace. 
“Presence partly depends on the match between sensory data and internal representation” - the mimetics or autocosmics.
Create world model that the game either cleaves to or confounds - the same with characters.
“We can believe in fictional objects… only if they mostly fit in our models.” Therefore autocosmics are important.
The reason
why we make this choice is because characters have often
a major role in the believability of book and movie sto-
ries. However, unlike book and movie characters, agents
should be able to cope with a wide range of possible sit-
uations without anyone to tell them what to do


 However, there is one criteria that can be used
for every domains. What have been named Eliza ef-
fect (Weizenbaum 1966) is really interesting: as long as
the agent is not actively destroying the illusion, people
tend to see complex thinking mechanisms where there
are not.

Predictability is a major problem for game characters. But not too much, or randomness - Tence &amp; Buche
Another flaw is obvious fail-
ure to learn. An agent keeping the same behavior even if
it is clearly counter-productive breaks the illusion of be-
ing “intelligent”. That is the main reason why we think
that believable agents must be able to learn (Gorman
and Humphrys 2007)

Francis McCormick sees it as “Forging The Gods” - precisely - we make them.
Not in total service to user, unlike sciences and other design - Leon says.

Must have a clear theory.

“A model is always a simplifciation, a kind of idealisation of what it is intended to model.” - “it… captures in a vivid, often formal way what is essential to understanding some aspect of its structure of rbehaviour” - we cannot include every aspect, our choices of what we do include “imply… purpose” - we author every simulation we make. 


A model is… a different object from what it models. 



Tence &amp; Buche see ‘believability’ as ‘acting like a human’ - not always the case - I am not looking at their definition of ‘believability’, really.

Tence &amp; Buche - number of interactions are important to assessing believability. A lot can provoke HIGH believability, but higher risk of repetition or a mistake.


Difference between ‘believability’ and ‘resonance’ - believability is a part of ‘resonance’ and so we should aim higher.
Of course, single
player games can achieve human-like agents but they
will not be believable as we defined it.


WHAT IS BELIEVABILTIY IN THIS CASE? HOW DO WE EVALUATE IT? (this goes in ideal player experience)


First thing you do in Last Guardian is save Trico’s life, to cement bond.

“Their developing bond is the key theme across the game,” Ueda says. “But the big difference between this and the relationships in Icoand Shadow of the Colossus is that there’s a more dynamic range between the boy and Trico. From that first moment in the game, the boy is uncertain if Trico will be a friend or foe, and you immediately start trying to work out how to bridge that communication gap.
“But rather than the more straightforward relationships seen in Icoand Shadow of the Colossus, you’ll see both dramatic peaks and troughs in their relationship…”

Norman is always cited by games designers - and there is much to look at - but it easy to forget the artistry.
Bogost - Brenda Romero’s train makes you interact with game pieces roughly - the game’s context makes the action ambiguous, through autocosmics - the faceless characters on the train. 

Even chess has its characters - Go could be anything. How much projection is there onto Go pieces?
Bogost (104) - “videogames have frequently inherited from the tradition of puzzles”
“Videogames are good at manipulating objects in space.” (same page)

The sublime is different from the beautiful in landscape - (kant) - nonsensical, non-understandable. Can a videogame environment be sublime, as we CAN understand it and find its borders?
The sublime is a border between imagination and reason - an autocosmic overwhelming. Largeness, fear, misunderstanding.
We can interrogate the sublime if we consider character as environment. 
Bogost defines between mathematical and dynamic sublimity - the function of time and movement makes a game environment dynamically sublime. It depends whether you are interacting with the systems as to which sublimity is relevant. 
The sublime comes in the experience, not the system or the aesthetics, but the experience of both.

Bogost - “Work Is The Best Place To Goof Off” - the meanings of ‘simulation’ vs. ‘Game’ - the former has echoes of realism, seriousness, the latter of levity, frivolity, pointlessness.
Simulations are magic circles - practice medical techniques without killing anyone, for example.
A simulation has “resistance to abstraction” - we need abstraction, I think? Therefore looking for realism in games misunderstands art. But you must make some strides towards realism. People disagree about where to stop.
Simulators are often lampooned - goat simulator an example of ‘non simlator’
Play Rock Simulator 2014.;
“A simulator will become a workthat shows the intrinsic impossibility of representing a chosen subject with playable computer graphics, rather than computation’s inevitable mastery of the physical world” - an anti-utopian, surrealist sub-genre - computing won’t solve everything - is what I am doing a simulator in that sense, then?

“Sometimes being in control is too facile, too misleading” - can we really understand a character more by occupying them? Bogost thinks “passivity is underrated”. Agency does not mean “understand a character from the inside”, it means “control them from the outside.”
In abstract games “you” are the pretend god in control of a manipulable world on which meaningful force can be exerted” - but the god here is the world! You can influence it, but only in very strictly-defined ways - ritual is a metaphor for this. 
“Proteus is a game about being an island instead of a game about being on one” Like mountain. It’s a game about empathy. Add it to the empathy list!

Do you even exist in my game? Then player? Or is it about being a god, feeling a god?

 It does not come as a surprise, however, that despite fierce opposition, particularly in recent cultural history, aesthetic illusion seems to be more alive than ever and continues to influence the development of contemporary (digital) technology for, in particular, commercial representations (resulting, e.g., in the enhanced life-likeness of films on blu-ray 3 D discs with dolby 5.1 surround sound), since immersion appears to cater well to a fundamental human need for imaginary experience.
“Is it (strong AI) necessary or even desirabele for practical benefits?” Goodwinds.
Don’t care about computational elegance, as long as it works and there is enough memory. (Patrick Wilson)

In the video game industry, models are often quite
basic but can achieve good believability in the hands of
skilled game designers.
Some agents
combine reactive and deliberative abilities to have both
advantages without the weaknesses. - Tence and Buche
Action selection is a fundamental part of intelligent behaviour, yet no consensus has so far
emerged for the best mechanism to be used for AI systems, or even for particular classes of
problems.(bryson

Which models are useful in science, which in games and which in art? Are these distinctions arbitrary (from Tence and Buche)

Games (Norman) “a category in which designers deliberately flout the laws of understandability and usability. Hide critical components, make things difficult to do, require precise timings, don’t give feedback, use unnatural mappings so that system state is difficult to interpret.
“Making things difficult is a tricky business”

should need minimal a priori knowledge. This implies
that the model does not need to be easily understand-

Character as process, world as data.
Swarm &amp; Flocking

A computational technique most clearly seen in cellular automation; small, simple individual ‘agents’ all act in a space according to a limited set of rules to produce “unexpected behaviours”. A performative, paracosmic ideal in computing; simple rules produce the appearance of complexity.
Can be used in almost any sphere of computing to produce similar results.
        “I've said it over and over: I don't want people playing to particular endings. I want them to play the game and get whatever result comes naturally, because that is what the game is built for. It's a dispenser of stories, customized to the individual who is playing at the moment.”

Michael Resnick - computer is not an evocative object, but can be used to create evocative objects. A computer has no meaning in isolation, must be part of a system.
I am making this like a game - not just do whatever you want - it is an authored experience, an environment, and games are religious spaces (huizinga).
They require a world in which to act - it provides the data (character as environment).
Very granular
Tale-Spin is a system (similar to Versu)
All subsequent work on AI-based story generation included “explicit modeling of author-level knowledge, in addition to character-level modeling. In interactive drama, this plays out as the distinction between the drama manager and autonomous characters.”
We need a drama manager, somebody to fudge and change things depending on contexts.
Unlike a human player,a computer character
feels no joy in winning and no humiliation
in losing. In the end, the player knows a bot
simply does not care, which makes beating
it a thankless task. We anticipate that creat-
ing bots that mimic human players’involve-
ment in the game would make them more
appealing as opponents

Our hypothesis is that the nature of online
conversations is unstructured enough to let
us exploit classic text-processing techniques
to fake participation in them.

Furthermore, the bot maintains a simple
valence memory of how it has responded to
each player currently in the game. Valence
is not a simulation of emotion—rather, it
presents a semblance of context in the bot’s
conversations. A high positive value indi-
cates that the bot has reacted positively to
the player, and a negative value suggests a
history of negative reactions.

The bots would jump
from topic to topic without any history other
than the general valence toward the speaker.
Over an extended period of time, this prop-
erty becomes quite noticeable. The system
needs a better way of representing the cur-
rent topic and should maintain a minimal
topic history. A mechanism such as a decay-
ing episodic memory model associated with
each player in the game would help. The sys-
tem would also benefit from some mecha-
nism for finding and mimicking patterns in
verbal behavior.

I have sympathy with the utilitarian view of AI, and the games - making things for people, not for philosophers.


Systmeatising as opposed to narrative - dithering is very literary, but antithetical to computer science. &quot;It is dramatically depicted ambivalence rather than efficient goal selection that makes a sequence of events into a story.&quot;

AI as engineering has gone well, but not as cognitive science - as long as it does the job, it doesn't matter
TaleSpin used animals as ‘humor’ and a way to demonstrate ideas simply 
“The idea of using talking animals in the stories (Joe Bear et al.) was Roger’s idea. Clearly, we weren’t going to get very sophisticated or elaborate output from this program, but we could illustrate the basic ideas, and the animals gave it a bit of humor.”
But I think animals can make fine story-subjects without being just placeholders.
All about unpredictability
TaleSpin is now lost - only in memory, autocosm - makes the context of it different (re. Audience sympathy
“Chunking” of character in Black &amp; White - ‘creature loses a lot of his charm  the more you train him  because he is focused (becomes useful, but robotic)’ - Amanda Yaklin AI becomes predictable once it is ‘trained’ - therefore don’t ‘train’, don’t allow mastery - you cannot sculpt everything in game world.
Some things need to be made automatic - micro-managing creature becomes tedious after a while. Only a very limited set of variables that the creature responds to (and all laid out at the start of the game!) Because the idea is to ‘win’, rather than ‘experiment’, you must provide a ‘fair’ amount of hand-holding to the player with the creature.

the primary focus for believable agents is not intelligence in these activities or in general.”

Anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that
Groo has succeeded in its goal of realistic

tested the Groo bots, and we also demon-

eral participants played it. Reactions were

And, as Laurel quotes in Computers As Theatre,  “movies did not flourish until the engineers lost control to the artists.” Artists are important to computing: they help create the experience that arises from the manipulation of a computer’s constraints and structure. 
Not sure I agree with this anymore. Not quite.
Re. Conway’s game of life - how we characterise ticks (as generations) influences the thing they control - a second, depending on the metaphor of the microsecond could represent an entire universe.
Talespin created stories through interaction, rather than at a high level of predetermined drama.

Lasseter talks about applying traditional models of animation to computer-based animation to make excellent computer animation - arts influencing science. 
Even computers require an abstraction, a paracosm - (weiz) we “work… with a symbolic aertifact that, for [us], is the machine.” “We conceptualise the machine at many different levels.” This concpetual metaphor becomes a “determinant of [our] view of the world.”

Believable agents are a combination of autonomous agents and believable characters
from the traditional character-based arts, such as animation, film or literature
If the character do es not react emotionally to events? if they don?t care?
then neither will we? The emotionless character is lifeless? as a machine?
Not sure about this “create a system so others can make stories” - you aren’t just creating a technology, its an ontology of doing things as well - make things samey. Story is not separate from system. 
fachidiot
In AI, people want to use shared ontologies, but most are pretty specialised - authored. 
Again, Loyall is trying to create a system for generally making believable agents - this systematic approach isn’t the only way.

Practice-based pHD can’t really do a system - needs to be something specific

 instead create a ‘good-enough system’, based on anything that we can get our hands on, to create the best experience possible. 

Unlikeacademics, most artistscreateartifactsand say littleabout themethod bywhich they

Most modern AI researchers see it as a utility field, rather than a humanistic, expressive, utopian “mad-scientist” field. McCorduck against this.


Writers start with nothing and create characters
through words.


The stance I am taking, then, is that of ‘Scruffy AI’ (called ‘connectionist’ by Minsky); that of localised, jerry-rigged, fudged-together solutions to my narrative problems, rather than a Platonic system.
“Scruffies are hackers, who will cobble together a system built of anything - even logic”.
Might we call this, then, Jalopy AI, MacGuyver AI, Hacked AI, Jugaad AI, Bodge AI, Kludge AI, Heath Robinson AI etc. Etc. This relates quite strongly to my choice of character as environment in the face of the tools that I had available to me as an amateur (that is, an environment-based, level-ontology platformer/shooter game engine). 
Loyall on artists - These artists have been
studying believability, and advancing the art for millennia.

Loyall talks a lot about ‘personality’ of a character - not through exposition, but through action.

A palliative relationship. Not objectives-based like most games.
Here, when we talk about the ‘computer’, we could be talking about the ‘program’.
Strong AI vs. AI research[edit]
Searle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers &quot;don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.&quot;[2] The primary mission of artificial intelligence research is only to create useful systems that act intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is &quot;merely&quot; a simulation.
Searle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built thatacts more intelligent than a person, but does not have a mind or intentionality in the same way that brains do. Indeed, Searle writes that &quot;the Chinese room argument ... assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition.&quot;[41]
Searle's &quot;strong AI&quot; should not be confused with &quot;strong AI&quot; as defined by Ray Kurzweil and other futurists,[42] who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the amount of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a super-intelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.
Computer knows syntax, not semantics
Not really interested in player as a character.
AI (according to nuclai) is not part of game design - it is just an element of design as a whole.
Key to the theory of simulation in AI is the Chinese Room argument - that, essentially (without descending into the thought experiment itself, which is better described elsewhere) a computer simulates intelligence, consciousness and complexity, while actually only being a machine without intention or self-awareness; therefore, the ‘Strong AI’ movement is misplaced, and its goals are unattainable. This has since been taken up by cognitive science as an attack on the view of human brains as computational. Searle believes in “biological naturalism”, which states that there are unknown qualities in the human brain that make consciousness unique and unrepeatable in a machine. He believes that the process that creates consciousness is non-mechanical and non-computational. 
This is related to the hard problem of consciousness, itself autocosmic.

There needs to be a desirable “user image” of the fictive ecosystem that we have put there - how they think it works
“Naive physics of computing”

For decades, humans had to speak the language of the
machines when they wanted to communicate with them.
Starting from the first mechanical calculating machines from
the 17th century, where the operators had to understand the
internal mechanisms to get valid results, this habit continued
until the 1970s, when human still had to ‘‘talk’’ to comput-
ers via punch cards (Redin, 2007). A major shift in human–
machine interaction took place in the 1980s with the
introduction of graphical user interfaces and accompanying
features like drag-and-drop, a trash can for the deletion of
files, or a desktop (like in reality, cluttered with papers
and files). None of these interface features is a necessity
for the machine, but they enhance usability by referring to
well-known work flows from the physical world (e.g.,
‘‘grabbing a file and throwing it into the trash can’’). A pre-
liminary culmination in the evolution toward a more user-
centered communication has been reached in the efforts to
develop humanlike synthetic characters (embodied conver-
sational agents, ECAs), whose purpose is to allow natural
verbal and nonverbal communication (Cassell, Churchill,
Prevost, &amp; Sullivan, 2000).
 No final def-
inition of believability has been arrived at so far, and several
fine-grained distinctions of different types of believability
have been proposed (e.g., Rose, Scheutz, &amp; Schermerhorn,
2010) -&gt; both inherent in the robot, and in the perceiver. Same as resonance.
“Even the most technical discussions about computers  use terms borrowed from human mental functioning.”

Believ-
ability of an ECA is the extent to which human interaction
partners can intuitively communicate with it by applying
natural processes of human communication
Brennan - “people’s expectations about human/computer interaction are often inherited from what they expect from human/human interaction”.
Thus, the general idea of believability is to enhance and
ease human–machine interaction by using natural and intu-
itive codes of human communication

Humans have certain
expectations about communicative signals, patterns, and
reactions of interaction partners. Believability of an ECA
means that humans can apply their usual mental models
of communication.

 However, it
has been debated whether humanlike internal processes
are necessary at all, or whether the replication of surface dis-
plays is sufficient for a believable and effective communica-
tion. Kra ¨mer, Iurgel, and Bente (2005) argue that to reach
the ultimate goal of an ECA – to make the human–computer
interaction more intuitive and to manipulate the emotions of
the user – it is not necessary to simulate internal processes in
terms of an emotion model or motivation model. Instead
they propose a conversational function model where emo-
tional expressions are seen as purely instrumental and dis-
connected from the feeling of emotions (cf. Fridlund,
1991).
Computers are “objects-to-think-with”
The computer is not really special, it is just another way to think about ourselves.
Authored approach is slow
He begins with three axioms:
(A1) &quot;Programs are formal (syntactic).&quot;
A program uses syntax to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the semantics of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it doesn't know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.
(A2) &quot;Minds have mental contents (semantics).&quot;
Unlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.
(A3) &quot;Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics.&quot;
This is what the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.
Nintendogs - must use fingers, rather than stylus - to maintain connection.xSearle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:
(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.
This should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don't have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore programs are not minds.
This much of the argument is intended to show that artificial intelligence can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the computational theory of mind correct?[g] He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:
(A4) Brains cause minds.
Searle claims that we can derive &quot;immediately&quot; and &quot;trivially&quot;[35] that:
(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.
Brains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it &quot;causal powers&quot;. &quot;Causal powers&quot; is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot;. &quot;Equivalent causal powers&quot; is whatever else that could be used to make a mind.
she says that computational microworlds do not teach us about empathy, shades of gray - not to diminish them, but to put them in their place - but what about as signallers, aeolian harps in a way, for having us teach ourselves?
Virtual spouse game - lots of believabiltiy, heider and simmel-esque attachment to simple avatars.
And from this he derives the further conclusions:
(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.
This follows from C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot; produce minds, it follows that programs do not have &quot;equivalent causal powers.&quot;
(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.
Since programs do not have &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot;, &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot; produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.
Speed &amp; COmplexity argument
But can we know the minds of another? Black Box, ‘zombie’ theory, hard problem of consciousness? Does simulation matter?
If we can’t detect consciousness, can it be said to exist?
Is there a point in distinguishing between simulation and actual consciousness?
Carter’s approach, and my own, move away from classical AI ideas of ‘personality but no past’, itself a softening of Wolfram’s ‘plain brain’ idea. My creature has a past, and it has an author, and that author’s stamp is all over the character.
ELIZA went from joke to pointed demonstration of humanity’s over-trust in computers. 
Problem might be that there is little character “resonance” in games because they are not concerned with character, but rather with action! “Features of the modern literary novel set it apart from most bestselling thrillers or romances,” they wrote. “Through the use of … stylistic devices, literary fiction defamiliarizes its readers. Just as in real life, the worlds of literary fiction are replete with complicated individuals whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration.” - we need more “literary videogames.”


“The computer, like a Rorshach inkblot test, is a powerful projective medium.” 
“Machine can act as a projection as a part of the self”
This idea of an 'understanding model' - info must be useful to manipulating the simulation, or nothing - this is too polarising.

HCI is all about autocosmics
‘Pre-copernican’ with computers.
Huizinga - personification is a “playing of the mind” - let the mind do the non-linear work.
Viewers of a
fictional program may be less concerned with its objective truth status
(whether the events described actually occurred) and more concerned
with whether the work meets some plausibility criterion (realistic char-
acters, settings, or sensible ideas; see Busselle &amp; Greenberg, 2000; Green,
2004; Green, Garst, &amp; Brock, 2004)

&quot;one might set up one's own personal game&quot; - in your own head!
Sidenote: simulation now means something different in games.
“In recent years low-interaction, low-challeneg 3-D games have become quite popular”
Weiz - computer is not a calculator - it is fundamentally a “symbol manipulator”.
Bogost (154) - “the conventions of challenge, action and interactivity that videogames so often insist separate them from the stodgy changelessness of novels, films, even the plastic arts.”
John McCarthy - “Machines With Common Sense” - certain elementary verbal reasoning processes so simple that they can be carried out by any non-feeble minded human have yet to be simulated by machine programs.
&quot;one is knower and dupe at once. But one chooses to be the dupe.&quot;
Mimesis - “the structure of the story world relates to that of the natural world” For Oatley, this means simulation rather than representation.
He talks about the difficulty of having machines learn through observation and exclusion, of having a machine “simulate” behaviours before trying them out.
The only way we know of expressing abstractions (such as the previous example of the opposition in checkers) is in language. That is why we have decided to program a system which reasons verbally.”
The difference between declarative (human) and imperative (machine) sentences. While imperative is quick and easy, declarative allows implication, use previous knowledge and more organic.
We get the gestalt (a form of chunking? Or the reverse?)
Game characters need to be in a sympathetic environment (like supersition, like fairies)
Our actions and the environment have very little effrect on the characters - (apart from perhaps PCs) - they are just nodes. This is what we need to open out - open out the ports of where we can interact with character, make them emergent; character as distributed.
This is an attempt at general strong AI.
User model - how the player thinks things should work

Program model - how it actually works. This is always right.

&quot;the advent of the computer has taken our relationships with technology to a new level. Computers, with their reactivity and interactivity, stand in a novel and evocative relationship between the living and the inanimate. - Turkle

Naomi Alderman - I have been playing the newly released Fable III this week. You can play as a male or female hero, and marry either sex too – no distinction between marriages and civil partnerships here. Fable III is also bug-laden. When I held my in-game husband's hand, he would coo at me; when I let go, he'd snarl &quot;You murdering beast!&quot;. I decided he had mental health problems. When he died, tragically, of another bug, and our virtual child unaccountably changed race, I found myself wondering if I should find a new partner of the same race as little Louise, to make her more comfortable. If anything, this game was making me too empathetic.

But empathy's not in the game, it's in the person playing – and the idea that games could erase such a fundamental human trait is pretty peculiar.

kiethng in the comments of the above - But Fable is a unique case, isn't it? The original Fable was the first game where I made purely empathic decisions - I *wanted* to be nice to characters and to &quot;do the right thing&quot; without any tangible in-game reward to do so.

With Fable and Black &amp; White, the whole point was to separate the &quot;moral&quot; aspects from the reward structure, so that the primary game mechanics never drive you towards good or evil. It used purely emotional cues (e.g. a sad face and a whimper on your 60-foot pet tiger) to engage players on &quot;moral&quot; decisions - hence, empathy.

But Fable and B&amp;W were designed around this. There aren't many other games that do so. Usually, &quot;doing the right thing&quot; implies experience, points, money or loot - it's pretty rare that we make in-game decisions based on this sense of empathy.
Eliza Effect - &quot;attributing greater intelligence or intentionality to a machine than it possesses&quot;
Turing - a machine does not need to think, only act intelligent
Go back to computers having less functionality, more evocation - in our heads, not in our computers.
As Turkle says, don’t go to far with the paracosm - use it to enhance this life, not disappear into a shallow, lonely digital life.

Wolfram thinks “there isn’t a distinction between the intelligence and the merely computational” - can compute all intelligence!

“What could it mean to speak of risk, courage, trust, endurance and overcoming when one speaks of machines.” - machines is such a simplistic way to look at it now!

Turkle doesn't necessarily think it is important as to the objective truth of 'what is self' etc. What is most important is how we use technology to reflect ourselves. We haven't solved that yet. A purely engineers approach is not good. But the artist's way must become more like the engineer's; building, making, experimenting with new technuqyes. This is what art has always done, and is what will happen here. 
'relational artifacts' are about the emotions they seem to be expressing - very key to autocosmics, on a deep, emotional level. Primed for art.
She speaks of children wishing their toys had 'hearts' as well as 'minds'.
&quot;new debates about relational and sociable machines&quot; - 'not about the machine's capabilities but about our vulnerablities&quot; - I'm not explicitly addressing this, but it confirms that relational artifacts are important. 
&quot;today we are faced with relational artifacts that elicit human responses&quot;
'relational artifacts could be... self-objects that never disappoint'.
JOHN mACcARTHY - robot and baby 
In this, against a performative robot - more trouble than its worth. The robots are passive ciphjers. It’s the human’s fault.  We could give a robot emotions, but we shouldn’t. He allies with Weizenbaum in this respect.
“Slightly repellent voice” so don’t empathise to much. 
Not allowed to be cute - “giant mechanical spider”. He ignores the aspect of this that would impact how we interact with it. It’s disingenuous to act as if this would have no impact on our interactions. 
“The problem was not with robots… but with people” - people project onto robots.
No, sir. Robots are not programmed to love. I am simulating loving the baby.”
Crude disguise to get the baby to be happy. 

&quot;Discussions about computers become charged with feelings about what is special about people&quot;; (Turkle)


80kb chip in a furby!

Brenda Laurel’s Computers as Theatre was one of the few truly transformative books to emerge in the heady early days of the “digital revolution,” demanding that we think of the computer as posing a series of creative problems that might best be address through the lens of the dramatic arts rather than purely technical problems that remain in the domain of the computer scientists. 

Brenda Laurel has been and remains an important voice — in many ways, the conscience of the digital industries 

Henry Jenkins points out links between Turkle and Laurel
&quot;both... understanding something of the mental models people brought with them to computers&quot;

The relationship between the books may have been that we were each looking at the coming wave of technology as something fundamentally about humans, our social and developmental and cultural contexts.

 I suspect that the lack of civility in multiplayer spaces today (especially in terms of sexual harassment) has something to do with the general lack of civility in our national character at this moment in time. But it also has to do with the designer’s role in framing and normalizing civil relations among multiple participants. 



Her Story developer - what the player wants to do must be supported - what do they want to do with the creature.
It is a form of agency - Oatley looks at this idea.
“Imaginative participation I n games of make-believe”
Therefore we are creating a chinese room experience, really.
10.6 Study the Arts (Believable Characters)
The final issue I want to address for how to build believableagentsis to study thecharacter-
based arts. The space of knowledge in this area is large and nearly completely uncharted
by computer scientists. The nearest cousins to believable agents are believable characters.
This domainisimmense, but artistshavebeen workingto understandit formillennia. What
they know may be foreign. It may undermine long held beliefs for computer scientists (as
it has for me). But when they are right,researchers in believableagents ignorethem at their

Therefore games cannot induce it - must rely on it?


Keith Oatley [Finish with him? Most modern, using computer metaphor, the idea of ‘simulation’ being computational or human in source.]
“At the risk of being anachronistic I propose that what Aristotle really meant by  mimesis was something different. We can come closer to this meaning by considering a new technological metaphor, the computer. Aristotle's notion was that a play is not so much an imitation - it is a simulation of human actions. Actions are displayed by actors in the theatre and - more importantly - the play must run on the minds of the audience, as a computer simulation runs on a computer (Oatley, 1992). Minds have this potentiality for simulation, for making models of the world (Craik, 1943). Novels and plays work by guiding the simulation process. The core of this simulation is identification with one or more characters: the central process is that the reader runs the actions of the character on his own planning processes, taking on the character's goals, and experiencing emotions as these plans meet vicissitudes. So according to this theory the performance of a play or the text of a novel is a simulation just as a computer program can be a simulation; and in order to work the simulation must be run. Literary simulations run on minds of audiences or readers, just as computer simulations run on computers.”
“They offer themselves up as the mind-platform on which the story is run.”
Oatley lays out a ‘taxonomy of literary responses’ - sympathy, incorporation, indenitifcaiton based on mimesis - sees mimesis not as imitation, but as simulation - “fictional simulations run on people’s minds”
“They achieve significance for us by becoming parts of our schemas”
He feels that intensity of emotions felt involves making fictional characters less like strangers and more like friends. 
“For them to run successfully readers (a) adopt a character's goals and use their own planning procedures to connect actions together meaningfully, (b) form mental models of imagined worlds, (c) receive speech acts addressed to them by the writer, and (d) integrate disparate elements to create a unified experience.”
“great writers allow readers to respond creatively, to feel moved emotionally, to understand within themselves some of the relations between actions and emotions, and sometimes to undergo cognitive change.”
“To increase the chances of transformation the author offers a character with whom one can connect, a certain suggestiveness, dilemmas, a range of ambiguities, something like a set of raw materials and hints at construction, a kit of parts.”
&quot;At the centre of any narrative reading or drama, then, is a constructive, imaginative, act. It is synthetic and can be contrasted with the analytic activities of science.&quot;
Goal-adoption.
“Following a plot requires that actions be run on our planning processors. This is the basic modality of simulation.”
The author - “starting up and sustaining a coherent dream/simulation” then reader creates a “seamless world”.
For any simulation to work, non-essential correspondences are excluded, to explore more effectively how essentials interact. (oatley)

“The whole play must run on the minds of the audience, as a computer simulation runs on a computer”
Meeting Of Minds (1999) - he talks about the intensity of “meeting”  between reader and book or reader and author. Meetings between reader and author, reader and characters (following on from Bahktin). “Products of meetings in fiction are emotions, memories and thoughts”
“Such texts supply both words that point to the story world and directions to help interpret these words.”
The purpose of art is not to instruct, or change views, or peer-reviewed consensus (like that of a scientist, or even a non-fiction writer) but to meet minds. Just one form of autocosmics.
“Has some of the characteristics of meeting friends”. Different from everyday encounters, but some similarities. We experience real emotion.
“Whereas computer simulations run on computers, literary simulations… run on minds”
“We process information and understand the full range of options open to the characters.”
Fiction does not imitate the world, it simulates it. Not a straight transcript, but an interpretation to make things knowable by a reader. “Offer contexts” and a “discourse structure” to go with the “event structure”.
“From trains of action the cogherent set of goals and patterns of habitual planning that compose what in the theory of fiction is called ‘character’” - he is sort of against character as isolated element as well!
“The simulation works if a reader or spectator can get the whole thing to run - to imagine the story world with its people, and to become absorbed in it.” Here we see the link between the quality of the literary work and these theories.
Oatley and Gholamain - “what a writer of fiction provides is verbal guidance that will start up the theaters of our brains, stimulating them to construct a certain coherent experience…”
His conception of ‘structures’.
Event Structure -&gt; Discourse Structure -&gt; Association Structure. Mixing the first two around creates the association structure (I.e. autocosmics)
“Occasionally, when story structure, discourse structure, and associative structure occur in special configurations, meetings of literature can occur at the fight aesthetic distance, so that we experience important emotions (our own, not those of the characters). On such occasions, as well as experiencing intimate and specific emotions we can think about them, perhaps even understand them for the first time.”
“creating a mental model of an imagined world” - oatley - we must simulate the system in our heads.
Sterne “can transmit the voice of the imaginary Shandy into our minds using nothing but printed woprds”
Real emotions DO arise while reading. 
He mixes literary criticism and cognitive psychology.
“One imports some but not all of one’s characteristics into the experience”
The reader has a set of mental schemata; in reading some of these are invoked, and they may also be challenged.
 Do we empathise with player characters? Matching hear rate. How does the player describe goals and struggles. “Perspective-taking”. “Do the players invest in the game’s storyline or are they more concerned with beating levels and achievng a top score?”

Happens in games, as well - the ideal gamer.

Shedlosky-Shoemaker (2014) - significant correlation between self-expansion and identification with character.
“ Fictional characters may actually have the power to play a role in one’s social circle.”
‘Parasocial’ relationships.
“Secure place to explore potentially stigmatized relationships”
Self-expansion and cognitive overlap self is “cognitively merged” with the other - with the creature? One’s mental representation of the self and the other are muddied and interpolated. 
Self-expansion is slightly different - is the accruing of personal resources through interaction. Like self-improvement` I.e. reading a book about historical event. 

Green &amp; Brock - ‘psychological transportation’
forming a relationship with an interesting but potentially dangerous character (e.g., Tony Soprano) does not present the same obstacles in the narrative world as it might in the physical world.
“ fictional characters may offer a source of self-expansion, albeit to a lesser degree than do close others in the actual, physical world.
“Second, individuals perceived cognitive overlap with fictional characters to the degree to which those characters were representative of an individual’s actual self; however, self- expansion through fictional characters increased to the degree to which those characters were representative of an individual’s ideal self”
“this work suggests that immersion into narrative worlds can create opportunities for growth in which experiences, perspectives, and knowledge of fictional characters prompt readers’ own development.”
We don’t just relate to characters that are like us

Transported readers feel more positively toward narrative protagonists, report attitudes in accordance with those advocated by the narrative, report greater enjoyment of the narrative, and indicate an increased willingness to return to the narrative world (e.g., Green &amp; Brock, 2000; Shedlosky-Shoemaker, 2006).
Its power to defamiliarize and as a result to assist readers to reflect on and reshape their cultural identity
Audience members are able to create meaningful relationships with fictional characters and these relationships might entail opportunities for novel experiences and personal growth, particularly if individuals perceive those characters as representing their ideal self or if individuals are immersed in the world created by the story

Study of IRI Empathy for fictional characters (nomura and akai 2012) - significant correlation between empathy for real people and fictional people (like Sklar)
Suggests that without empathy, may “not even understand the story”
Use the same scale, rather than different ‘Fantasy’ scale, for measuring empathy for fictional characters.
Identification is first/second person - not just simulating them, but becoming them, to a certain degree (in Oatley’s eyes). Different from ‘spectator’ role. A spectrum between these two, accord to Oatley.
Oatley “fiction… is not in any necessary conflict with empirical truth, but it prioritises two other kinds of truth; the coherence truth of simulation, and the personal truth of insight”

&quot;My confidence in the future of literature consists in the knowledge that there are things that only literature can give us, by means specific to it&quot;
He worries about the continuance of our ability to imagine in a world &quot;flooded with predetermined images&quot;
His idea of multiplicity very important for games - all the potential forms, all th ways that a story could go - moving between them - the ultimate variety of the world, the randomness of it

&quot;It is true that software cannot exercise its powers of lightness except through the weight of hardware... the iron machines still exist, but they obey the orders of weightless bits&quot;
&quot;Even while laying down the rigourous mechanical laws that determine every event, he feels the nedd to allow atoms to make unpredictable deviations from the straight line, thereby ensuring freedom both to atoms and to human beings&quot; Systematising does not preclude poetry and freedom.

Comments Section - all about characters in games. (Mary Sue article on fictional characters)


Boerma, Mol and Jolles (2016) - one's ability to mentally image can affect comprehension, and reading develiopment. (mental imagery - reading pictures) - crossing the media. Multimedia coalescence into one mental model. Needed a lot in games.

Divide between game AI and academic AI (c.f. Togelius) is like the divide between reader-response and formalists - systematic, assuming a system exists first, does not fit in vs. How to actually make things for people. Theory is very important, and must be referred to, but is often weakened by having to be right!

“Literary works, according to this
model,resemblemachines: theyaretheresultofaninten-
tional human activity in which a specific skill transforms
rawmaterialintoacomplexmechanismsuitableforapar-
ticular purpose” (Steiner, “Russian Formalism” 18)
art is machine is still useful, but not when it strips out the context and thie reader.

Now, in principle it is enough to buy a computer program for
rewriting Oedipus, Hamlet, Wuthering Heights, War and Peace, Crime
and Punishment, The Metamorphosis, For Whom the Bell Tolls. We
can do it. But do we really want to do so?

The devastating experience of discovering that, in spite of our
wishes, Hamlet, Robert Jordan or Prince Andrej died, that things
happened in that way, and forever, no matter what we wanted, hoped
or yearned during the course of our reading, makes us to feel the
shiver of Destiny. We realize that we cannot decide whether Ahab will
capture the Whale or not. The real lesson of Moby Dick is that the
whale goes wherever She wants.
Link possibility space of game characters to eco’s ‘handicapped world’, or the inevitable fatefulness, of literary characters.

eco's semiotic approach - characters &quot;will never change&quot; - similar to mathematical entities - is this as true in videogames. &quot;remain the actors of what they did once and forever - perhaps as, character exist within a frame of potential actions, even in a game.
We are losing the ‘charm of abstraction’ - the artful difference, and essentialism, between the map and the territory.
Jessica Riskin Automata - Montaigne was bored of them by 1500s!
Novels form a very small part of my remit, precisely because they are only one way to think about character. Existing artforms have useful lessons, but we must broaden our horizons (quote about game developers needing more influences)

Turkle talks about the giddiness of ppl discovering programming at thinking of the entire world as a system. I certainly had this. re. the pheasant.
&quot;discrepancy between theory and the experience of the self&quot;
“Tools… part of the stuff out of which man fashions his imaginatiove reconstruction of the world.” - any tool changes how we reconstruct the world in our heads, and thus how we experience it.”
His model works for somehting like the sims 3, in NPCs are relational abstractions within a larger system, but when character is the 
Use “ad-hoc if-thems scattered through code to affect emotions when interacting with objects.
Making traits simple and atomic means a lot of hand authoring as there are no emergent connections between traits. 
In Evans’ model actions don’t tightly cause emotions - instead they make conditions true which then lead to emotions. 
Don’t create numeric predetermined states- his model organically builds a personality out of behaviours. Numbers are very basic and opaque, they are quantitative rather than qualitative. 
Follow Turkle's logic - making better characters is not about producing 'real' AI, but about using AI as a culture to change how we think about people, or use existing ideas (autocosmics) to better suit the medium.
Obviously I agree with some of Weiz (and a bit of Turkle, as well) - can't think of minds as purely like computers, can't reduce everything to technical (if only because our technical is limited) - but can't disavow it, either. It does have some things to say about the world, if only in how we interpret complex systems as human animals.  The role of artists must be a piecemeal one; it mst be one of explaining through doing, of not laying things out neatly; it is a process that we can only hope will never end. re. my drawings for my creature; they are useful, but I can't always stuck to them; other things will come up. I am trying to understand the system, through authorship, but even the author must be their own audience.
Treat the brain as a 'grey box', and use it to augment the powers of the computer.
Environments-as-stories are not presented to us - we must go and find them.
Her whole book is reflective of the 'media equation' and of computers not as dumb tools, but as reflective mirrors.
“Humans are actually not very good sensors” - an AI character must either be artificially limited in its sensor array or instead be a god
This idea of the 'second self' - of computers as reflections of our own concerns and selves. Therefore characters are perfect for this; tools for self-realisation. Do not need to program for this, I don't think.

&quot;the emotional power of video games draws heavily on the computer power with that supports a simulated world and a meditative environment.&quot;

&quot;The entertainment industry has long believed that the highest payoffs would come from offering the public media that combine action and imaginative identification.

She points out that 'consistency' is what matters, more than anything else - why? Because of the audience. the rules are partly in the game, and partly in the audience's heads

&quot;rules-governed worlds&quot; - all fictional worlds are rules-governed - the difference is how and when they break!
Rules-based media - &quot;the spirit of a computer program&quot;
so, rules-based media is what we are interested in.
Turkle worries that the rules of games (mathematical in nature) are limiting. She thinks that making the rules too clear is a bad idea - freeform play allows identification, simulation, fictive empathy - we can have both, as has been proved. Her view of games is rooted in the early days of games, where the rules were all-encompassing.




BOD for Starcraft and Unreal Tournament.

Computational narratology - narratology is “a humanities discipline dedicated to the study of the logic, principles and practices of narrative representation.” Overlap with AI, game environments that interact with narrative. Can game environments only interact with narrative.?
Computers can be used to generate, or analyse, narrative -but I am taking an authorial approach to looking at narrative.Nothing wrong with systematisation, but it doesn’t work very well, I don’t think.
More coarse-grained accounts of the roles of characters in plot (Jannidis → Character), such as the narrative arc of Freytag (1900) and the heroic quest of Campbell ([1949] 1990), have also inspired the design of many interactive narrative systems (Mateas &amp; Stern 2005; Gervás et al. 2006).
The Formalists (I.e. Propp) had a big link to compuitational narratology.

Sroty understanding systems and planning formalisms - categorising stories cybernetically. Sotry generation algorithms. Very interesting, but more about systems analysis than stories.
In recent years, interactive narrative has been the major driver in the field, promising new varieties of aesthetic experience, aided by game engines and vivid animations. One of the challenges here (Mateas &amp; Stern 2005) is retaining authorial control over the plot while granting some freedom to the user (who may act as an animated protagonist) in shaping the evolution of the narrative.
Empowering the user can lead to aesthetically unsatisfying outcomes, but restricting her through constraints from the plot can limit engagement.
interactive narrative represents a new and evolving genre.

Older systems of computational narratology (planning, designing and delivering plot, choice vs. Restriction) need work.</Text>
            <Comments>It is interesting why this is a major problem in games and not books, films etc. I think it is as much to do with context as interactivity of form.
How does this relate to the reactions/actions of the creature? I also disagree - plot often comes from automatic responses - the “fate” of the character.
I take this further, and perhaps create a representation as a designer of the system; for myself.
Again, I want to play with this idea and build hidden systems that actually function. Hiding some of the drama offstage. This relates to Garrard’s point about animals not just being performative for us, not just being bestand, of having a life of their own, unsupervised.

Not just their point of view; their entire conception initialises the game itself.

Not just critical thinking, but emotional engagement as well.
Note: the divide between ‘scruffy’ and ‘neat’ AI should not be confused with the contrast between ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ AI.</Comments>

Super Mario Bros.
There’s a bit of a dark past hidden in Super Mario Bros.’ booklet. The story, as described in the manual’s first few pages, involves the Koopa tribe turning the Mushroom Kingdom’s residents into bricks, stones, and “field horsehair plants” (commonly considered the game’s Fire Flower power-up). This would mean that Mario is actually shattering bricks with human souls when he grabs coins and ingesting people to throw fireballs. The sordid implications were eventually ret-conned, but the original manual stands as a sort of morbid tome to the Mushroom Kingdom’s sordid past.


Grimoires are books that contain a mix of spells, conjurations, natural secrets and ancient wisdom. Their origins date back to the dawn of writing and their subsequent history is entwined with that of the religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the development of science, the cultural influence of print, and the social impact of European colonialism.&quot;

 players never even have any physical traces that the game exists.

One of the greatest NES game manuals (and one of the greatest NES games in general) is the one that came packaged with the original The Legend of Zelda (1986), with its shining gilded cover and plethora of stories, hints, original, hand drawn artwork, and even a map of the beginning of the game.

But there is a certain magic in holding the instruction manual, that thin little booklet, and scouring over the tale, as if reading some ancient document. 

But there is a certain magic in holding the instruction manual, that thin little booklet, and scouring over the tale, as if reading some ancient document. 

Game manuals are less useful now that game graphics can introudce the world so much better.

 The instruction manuals allow games to get right into the action, allowing players to resort to them only when necessary. 

The internet has made finding secrets much easier. Another reason to isolate this game. 

This isn’t to say that some of the magic and mystery is gone from finding secrets in games, as there is a certain charm in working together on a message board or looking up tips on Youtube. But the dusty relic that is a game manual was an important part of the gaming experience for nearly a decade, and it is a shame to see it fall into obscurity.

One of gaming’s most infamous instruction manuals, the booklet for StarTropics (1990), an action-adventure game for the NES, features one of the most engaging and striking uses of meta in a video game (meta refers to something outside of the actual game). Attached to the game’s manual was a yellowed piece of paper, supposedly resembling parchment, that held a secret code within its fibers that could only be seen when some water was rubbed over the paper. During the quest, protagonist Mike Jones is told to “dip [the] letter in water,” and players are tasked with figuring out what this means.

StarTropics - letter
StarTropics – letter
The act of playing through the game and figuring out the mystery is quite the experience, and nothing quite like it has ever been done since. Since most players bought the game used, without a manual, the code was constantly published in Nintendo Power, but for those that solved the puzzle firsthand, it remains a great moment in gaming. The Virtual Console release of the game includes the letter in with the digital manual, and at the bottom of the screen is a small pail of water, which is Nintendo’s way of trying to be true to the material.

To Hinder a Sportsman from Killing any Game.
Take a stick of green elder, from the two ends of which thou shalt clean out the pith.
In each end place a strip of parchment of hare-skin, having written thereon with the
blood of a black hen the following character and word. (See Figure 7.) Having made
two of these slips, place one in each end of the stick and close the apertures up with
pith, afterwards on a Friday in the month of February thou shalt fumigate the afore-
said stick with suitable incense thrice in the air, and having taken it thence thou shalt
bury it in the earth under an elder tree. Afterwards thou shalt expose it in the pathway
by which the Sportsman will pass, and once he has passed by it, he need not hope to
kill any game during that day. If thou shalt wish a second time to lay a spell upon him
in like manner, thou needest but to expose the stick again in his path; but take care to
bury it again in the earth under an elder tree, so as to be able to take it from thence
each time that thou shalt have need of it; and to take it up each time as soon as the
Sportsman shall have passed.

Attention - Victor Shklovsky, in the
early essay Art as Device (1917), empha-

claims that the habitual nature of every-
day experience makes perception stale
and automatic, but
art exists that one may recover the sen-
sation of life; it exists to make one feel
things, to make the stone stony. The
purpose of art is to impart the sensa-
tion of things as they are perceived
and not as they are known. The
technique of art is to make objects
‘unfamiliar’, to make forms difficult,
to increase the difficulty and length
of perception because the process of

            <Title>Extra Simulation Context</Title>
            <Text>[See individual schema for citations for internal models]

Using a modular, OOD approach, mostly inspired by the BOD schema developed by Joanna Bryson, amongst others, including Ronald Brooks’ Subsumption Architecture.
Simulation is a “model-based reactive agent” (Russell &amp; Norvig). It uses modular, atomic behaviours in conjunction with sophisticated contextual planning algorithms to create reactive behaviour.
It does not use complex AI methods such as search. The BOD schema has no place for search, as it is often overly complicated, slow, resource-heavy and unreactive. By using BOD’s authored, iterative approach I retain control over my character, create complexity, avoid ‘dithering’ behaviours from insufficient algorithms. Reactive architectures are reactive, responsive, can deliberate and have explicit goals; all suited to believable characters.
However, it does have internal state, memory and internal models. This is partly to primitively explore my ideas surrounding autocosmics and the character as an environment (both internal and external). I believe I have struck a balance; the system is still simple enough to construct, tweak and understand, while allowing for more complex behaviour which will not be repetitive, which will change over time and adapt to the user. The agent is still reactive, however. I am heavily influenced by the mechanistic, ethological approach of biosemiotics, and its related fields, as a juncture between internal state and reactive architectures. Bryson is not against modelling and consciousness if the creature needs to learn and change, and the environment is bounded and the rate of learning is very bounded. The installation environment, and the limited mental functions of the creature, will ensure this.
I am also interested in seeing how such systems can degrade in such a way that gives rise to autocosmic sympathy; how to turn the frustration and ‘black-box’ corruption of the creature-as-machine into a autoscosmic sympathy, sense-made through prolonged imaginative interaction.
I have kept the internals as simple as possible. I hope that its personality, not created as a module but infused throughout its construction will allow people to fill in the gaps, to seek patterns and understanding, as they would in any complex systematic environment. 
Many ideas taken from AI approaches, particularly those which privilege the human. Game AI often uses BOD or a form of modular, reactive intelligence. 
Not a rigourous approach; I am bringing together lots of ideas as an artist, not necessarily elegantly, but in ways which suits my ends for this particular character. As Balkenius warns against, I am not seeking a one-size-fits-all approach to the AI of my creature, or attempting to define everything in a few simple principles. I hope that the relatively complex systems interacting in lots of ways (all interrelated, intereffective) that have simple outputs will make some sense in chorded form, and provide some characterisation, as well as providing a methodology, rather than a technology.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————

BOD

Bryson’s Edmund architecture preceded BOD.
Developed of a “modular rather than monolithic” cognitive architecture for virtual and robot agents by Joanna Bryson at MIT and Bath University, as well as elsewhere. It is an “organisational structure based on biological precedent”, an important point for my animal-focussed design philosophy.
“Decomposition of intelligent behaviour into easy-to-program modules.”
“Pursues a set of goals relatively autonomously, responding to the challenges and opportunities of dynamic environments that are not fully predictable.”
A modular approach to designing and building agents, either software-based or robotic. Read Bryson on modularity, her on evidence of modularity in organics and her definition of modularity, as well as a general definition.
Heavily inspired by O-O-D, BBAI, Colony Architecture , Multi-Agent Systems, theories of emergence and entity-component systems. In these fields, I’ve also looked at Herbert the Robot by Connell (see comment) and Braitenberg Vehicles (see comment).
As opposed to internal-state-model AIs, BOD agents are reactive rather than deliberative. They contain absolutely no search whatsoever.
Always designed by hand iteratively, by human beings.
Bryson admits that this model is based on a direct observation of how nature works in practice, linking her to ideas of character as environment, authorship and interpretation/impressionism.
BOD agents are a compromise between purely reactive agents and full-internal-state learning-and-reasoning agents. 
The key is to create believable behaviour by separating the flow of data (input and output from behaviours) from the organisational control, and taking into account not just internal or external factors, but both.
Composed of POSH plans and Behaviour Modules which work in tandem, parallel and opposition to produce an overall behaviour, which “at any given moment is a choice of context, a focusing on a particular set of capabilities.
(Parallel, Ordered, Slipstack, Hierarchical) Plans are reactive plans (a form of action selection) in which hierarchies of goals and drives compete for primacy in a changing, contextual, non-deterministic environment. The plans determine which behaviour modules run and when, using a combination of the current state of the outside environment and the internal state and goals. This latter stabilises ‘dithering’ between rapidly changing states in the world. This is much better than other action-selection types, such as environmental determinism (if something is in a particular state, do a thing) finite-state machines (states change depending on situations, with different states allowing different actions) and basic reactive plans (which always react to the outside world, sometimes in different ways depending on the situation). POSH allows different combinations of factors to be reacted to in different ways, at various different rates of update, including push, pull and event-driven and other. 
As reactive plans, they have several fail-safe techniques built in to allow a continuous, harmonious and realistic/believable experience to take place when observing an agent; this includes expiry elements to stop looping behaviours, default outputs for all behaviours to prevent halting bugs and randomised heuristic leaps to other behaviours if a particular solution to a goal cannot be found, in order to ‘jump-start’ the creature’s behaviour (a form of annealing).
They are an example of subsumption architecture, in that different goals and priorities have different weights and importances and can suppress those less-important whilst running. This is the Slipstack Hierarchical part. 

The plans take three main different architectures for activating behaviours:

Drive Selection: high-level goals which tend to remain stable:
Competences: if-else actions which are contextual;
Action Sequences: reliable, linear and reactive behaviours.

￼

A single agent can have multiple plans, each running many different behaviours in parallel. 

——————————

Behaviour modules are self-contained micro-programs, or primitive algorithms. Each one handles a particular task; that might be an external action or may instead be long-term calculation, running in parallel with other behaviours. They are, ideally, black boxes; only their outputs can be accessed by the POSH plans or other behaviours, in order to promote ‘cleanness’ in the code and a lack of interdependency. 

Behaviour modules promote a modular identity for an agent; each “encodes [the agent’s] experience and memories” in part, and in working together they display, adapt and update that identity. As semi-autonomous modules, each contains their own perception, action, learning and memory; no state is stored centrally.

They are, in essence, black boxes: “behaviours have no access to each other’s internal state, but can monitor and/or alter each other’s inputs and outputs”. 

Importantly, behaviour modules should be atomic - they should not themselves be composed of further, smaller modules nested within them.

——————————


￼



Bryson’s main implementation, apart from a rather classical sheepflock/sheepdog dynamic, is to program a bot for Unreal Tournament, a navigational agent in a limited-but-non-deterministic environment that has been quite successful; demonstrating multiple goals simultaneously, showing a “strong modular composition”.

——————————-

BOD agents are iteratively designed, and this is an approach that I am taking with my godlet. The process is as follows:

“Decompose” the ‘platonic’ agent into a series of desired behaviours or actions on paper. I am taking a writerly approach to this with my micro-narratives.
Group, prune and turn these narratives into primitive, atomic behaviours.
Code behaviours, test, ”guide and prune”, add and augment as necessary, in cycles. It is important to simplify as much as possible as one goes, slowing the exponential growth in complexity as new features are added.

However, as Bryson herself notes, “although behaviour modules are themselves definitionally easy to create, engineering the interactions between behaviours has proved difficult.” 

———————————

BOD has proved an excellent starting point for my godlet which is easy to understand and which fits many of my ideas about the creature’s fiction. I particularly like the temporal element to it; in that all the structures are about update schedules. This is important to the strong temporal element in the project itself (chronemic), throughout its various media.

I will, however, be adapting its precepts to my needs, as it is important that I am creating a single, platonic character, not a system for characters: I will adapt my creature’s architecture to the fiction, and not the other way around.

I’m also concerned about there being no centralised internal model at all; how might an agent of Bryson’s have superstitions, beliefs, doubts? All of these are built on discrepancies between the outside world and the interior model. I suppose that behaviours could feed false data to the plan, or the sensors to the behaviours, or the plans to the actuators. Would this have the same result? Are memories and internal plans behaviours in and of themselves? Are the creature’s memories stored, quite literally, in its bones? This might help with my biological metaphor. 

——————————

Bryson was influenced (and cites) the slightly-earlier Ymir architecture by Kristinn Thorisson at MIT. It is a modular system for creating real-time, organic, fluid interactive agents (what Thorisson calls “full-duplex”). It takes in lots of different inputs through sensor fusion simultaneously and incrementally and provides corresponding multifarious, simultaneous output. The output and input are incremental, meaning that micro-reactions and micro-sensations occur constantly, building into a more complex, emergent sense/act cycle, and these inputs and outputs work together simulataneously as well, creating seamlessness. As Thorisson says, “Time should be an explicit part of the architecture’s structure and internal data.” This is a large part of my project as well. It allows any action to be stopped almost-instantaneously with a command, even the low-level behaviours. 

The architecture is more complex than that of BOD, consisting of perceptual modules, decision modules, blackboards and knowledge bases, arranged into layers; the Reactive Layer, the Process Control Layer, the Content Layer and the Action Scheduler. 

Thorisson created a reactive, virtual humanoid agent called Gandalf using this architecture that could interact multimodally (that is, through speech, gesture etc.) with a user to take them on a virtual tour of the solar system. This agent looks at objects in the room, gestures with its hand and acts on a more-or-less human timescale of task and space recognition. It is an interesting model for knole to consider.

————————————————————————————————————

Tweening

This is, basically, fuzzy interaction; making sure that there are smooth, organic transitions between states to give the appearance of responsive functionality and, in the case of agents, believability. Often, when computers break, they just break; it is a binary dropoff that is very jarring. Even when humans go wrong, as delineated in the Dartmouth Proposal, their subsequent actions ‘almost make… sense” - their actions are not robotic, stiff or just stop abruptly, but their behaviour might be a little strange. This is better than just stopping, and in agent design tweening states are imperative to give a believable sense of life. 

Chording

A concept (which is almost certainly well-established under other names) which relies in combining different data streams, variables and other qualities to produce unique results in context. Like a chord is an emergent sound from individual notes, so too can to different variables, images, and otherwise produce something new from their temporal, spatial and informational juxtaposition. It is related to sensor fusion, but is subtly different in that the fusion changes the result.

Layers

An important concept both front and back of the creature’s design; a modular approach to cognitive and biological architecture. Applies to the creature’s anatomy and its mind. Layers are groups with ‘depths’ (either spatial or conceptual) with limited interaction between each layer. Linked to the idea of neighbourhoods (Moore and von Neumann) from cellular automation, subsumption architecture and all across computer science, especially in game AI. It will be important to the BOD design to layer the creature on several planes - visually, by behaviour (in the POSH plans), and so on.

Swarm &amp; Flocking

A computational technique most clearly seen in cellular automation; small, simple individual ‘agents’ all act in a space according to a limited set of rules to produce “unexpected behaviours”. A performative, paracosmic ideal in computing; simple rules produce the appearance of complexity. Can be used in almost any sphere of computing to produce similar results.


Knowledge Representation

How to get subjective ‘world’ knowledge into a form that a computer can use, through simplification, division, abstraction and conversion, what can be called ontological engineering. As nucl.ai calls it, “modelling information about the world.” Difficult when input is extremely qualitative such as audio, image or voice. In this approach there is always a question of granularity; how much detail do you model? A KR system also needs to be able to handle uncertainty and exceptions, as well as leaving gaps in the data structures for new information and later modification.

This is something that I think is too important to ignore for my creature, and could perhaps be used in limited, seamless manner (or perhaps in an illusory manner). Image recognition, in particular, is important.

Multimodal Sequential Emotional Expressions

Developed by Sylwia Hyniewska during her time at Bath University. A theory of emotions expressed rather than felt. A performative extension of Leon Watts’ work. Emotion as “a dynamic episode that produces a sequence of response patterns on the level of gestures, voice and face”. Supposed to move away from solely facial expressions and into wider bodily expressiveness, but will be useful for modular facial design and creature-as-environment theory; the creature’s entire biological self will be able to change to respond to emotion. ‘Micro-expressions’ from different body parts “arranged [over] time”. TIME, linearity and sequence are key concepts here. Each expression is constrained in terms of: a) time taken; and b) contextual activation. A key example of chording.

Learning

“Extending the reach of the designer into unknown” (Russell &amp; Norvig). A machine updating its internal structure based on novel input and then recombining it with existing or other inputted knowledge to produce new behaviours. Through observations of regularity, constraints on what is to be learnt, finding the nearest example from the internal library that shares the most attributes, or through reinforcement, inferences can be drawn which can be used in future distinctions. This is an example of applied learning, or bootstrapping.

Turing Machine 

 A hypothetical machine described by Alan Turing in Computing Machinery and Intelligence and now the theoretical basis for most modern computers. Using a set of rules (in other words, an algorithm) a set of outputs can be determined from a set of inputs. This allows for simulation, programming, imitation of other machines and emulation.

PAD Model 

A model of emotions by Mehrabian and Russell in the mid-70s. It uses three numerical, fuzzy values (Pleasure, Arousal &amp; Dominance) to represent all emotions. P represents how nice or nasty and emotion is, the A represents the energy of the emotion and D represent how dominant or submissive the emotion makes one feel. Their values can be floating-point and theoretically infinite or limited to just a few scalar values.

Heuristics

As the creature is biologically inspired, seamlessness is more important than 100% correctness. Educated guesses and estimates (or, for a formal definition, “the relation of current state to final goal” (Russell and Norvig) that allow decisions to be made (rather than ‘cold’, random decisions with no data) that are ‘good enough’ by relaxing the constraints of a problem. Heuristics can be local or global (I.e. by how much data and foresight the algorithm has access to). This is also related to Herbert Simon’s bounded rationality, an idea put forward in Models of Man. In it, he states that human beings are not perfect decision-makers, and the possibility space of their decisions are constricted, or deliberately constrained, by limitations in the environments, past regularities in the space, patterns and time limits. This leads to satisficer decisions, or “good-enough” decisions. This could be applied to AI directly, or more generally to paracosmics and superstitions, which are satisficers for the complexity of the world around us; this has been phrased critically as human beings being less-than-optimal decision-makers; though the argument can be made that our satisficer tendencies often lead to us making better decisions more quickly than by taking the slow, completist rational route (Gerd Gigerenzer).

Agent

See Russell &amp; Norvig’s definitions: utility, reactive agent, reactive agent 2, model-based agent and goal-based agent.

Valence
 
A term borrowed from psychology to describe the pleasantness or unpleasantness of a consequence or emotion. It can be applied to decision-making, emotional expression, norm agreement or violation and many other factors in agent action selection. 

Fuzzy Logic

Neat logic composes of definite numerical or binary values that are absolute; they cannot be degraded in any way. Fuzzy logic, used for non-binary concepts such as belief, probability and utility, uses floating-point numbers to create degree values I.e. degrees of true or false along a scale.

Ontology

Generally, a set of meanings, and terms, that relate to one particular domain (jargon, technical language etc.) The term is often used in AI to mean a way of classifying things internally in an agent (as in Russell and Norvig).

Simulated Annealing 

Casting net wide in terms of leaps of exploration, then focussing on a local maxima.

Qualitative Physics 

Reasoning about things through comparison to each other, not through numeric values or detailed equations.

Reinforcement Learning 

A way of teaching a machine by tagging actions as either good or bad; through repetition, an “optimal policy for the environment” is learned. 

Factoring

Decomposing elements into blocks or ‘templates’ that can be recombined in many different ways. Used a lot in Game AI.

Event Calculus 

Turning events into objects with qualities.

Probability

A heuristic measure of likeliness. I have encountered them in Bayesian Networks (the probabilistic relationship between all states (a “complete model”) in terms of cause, effect and influence) and Markov Chains (a similar concept: chains of states in a state space with probabilities of moving between those states, usually expressed as a table of all possible moves (a transition matrix), without memory of past events or changes (the ‘Markov property’). Often used for modelling real-world events, and probabilities can change to allow for unpredictable change in systems). 

Randomness (Stochastics) 

Though it must be used with care, randomness is important to represent the illusion of organic deviation, of biology, and to introduce surprise to an algorithmic narrative.

Discrete State Machines (FSMs) 

Introduced to me by Turing - a machine or agent with a certain number of states, and a certain number of transitions between those states. A basic idea of computing and AI.

“Strong” vs. “Weak”

“Strong” AI is mostly theoretical; it involves the creation of human-level artificial intelligence in the truest sense, with general application in every domain of life. “Weak” AI, the domain of most AI scientists today, is AI that has a specific domain and task. This focus on the practicality of weak AI (after the failures of early utopian AI experiments) has led to the fragmentation of the field into numerous sub-disciplines, each a specialisation of the AI principle. John Searle invented these terms as part of his ‘Chinese Room’ argument.

Expert Systems 

A limited AI that is deployed for one particular task. In a way, the creature is both general and expert; that is, being expert at being itself. 

Heuristics

As the creature is biologically inspired, seamlessness is more important than 100% correctness. Educated guesses and estimates (or, for a formal definition, “the relation of current state to final goal” (Russell and Norvig) that allow decisions to be made (rather than ‘cold’, random decisions with no data) that are ‘good enough’ by relaxing the constraints of a problem. Heuristics can be local or global (I.e. by how much data and foresight the algorithm has access to). This is also related to Herbert Simon’s bounded rationality, an idea put forward in Models of Man.

            <Title>Brief Definitions</Title>
            <Text>
Do these definitions fit with our definitions of Anne, and Yocto?

It is outside the purview of this thesis to talk about the nature of character, but we do have to briefly say: What do we mean, or who?
Very little coherent study of characters separate from their narrative apart from in the last 15 years. (Jannidis).
“Idea of character undergoes variation in different phases of literature” (Bradbury, 2006).
Differing views of character from mere ingredient or device up to fully-fledged personhood. For some character is merely a negative space, a procedural silhouette of “effects” (Weinsheimer, 1979) in a plot or a simple “sum of binary oppositions” (Jannidis, 2013). Indeed, EM Forster (195?) calls them “word-masses”. Mine is a romantic approach, according to Bradbury (2006), “separate [characters] from surrounding fictional determinants” rather than “humanised outcroppings from some larger verbal design.”
Bradbury opposes this approach: “By definition in determined contexts” - are they really? There is definitely a move to see them outside of plot (narrative worlds rather than plot), especially in the modern world. Support for this comes from the legal profession. David Feldman (1981) (from a legal perspective) “increasingly, the commercial and popular appeal of fictional characters far surpasses the character’s role within the original work” or “created outside the context of any specific work”. He argues that the work should not reign supreme. Characters are not just “components of the works in which they appear”  Move up to transmedia and media theory today. (Needs expansion, possibly in chapter 2).
Hepola defines fictional realism for us. “Fictional realism is the claim that fictional characters—things like Antigone, Hamlet, Shere Khan, the city of Minas Tirath, and the like—actually do exist. According to a fictional realist, fictional characters are full-fledged, metaphysically respectable entities. Ophelia and Minas Tirath are as existent and as much a part of the real world as Kierkegaard and Copenhagen are.” 
Following on from Hepola’s point - we often see them as abstract entities but entities nonetheless (”Meinongian non-existents, as Platonic types, or as abstract artifacts”). Outside the realm of this essay, and my interests, to define the ‘reality’ of fictional characters (Though I will be assuming a form of reality later?), but we can state that they have some form of discursive reality, even if it is not objective. There exist concepts which are formed by concrete or mental material which we can speak around and about. Hepola splits this into attributes simpliciter and attributes “according to the story”, but obviously there are many more categories of attribute (headcanon, fan fiction, personal intrepretation etc.) 
I, obviously, side with those who see characters as interrogable separately, though would I go as far as to say that they are distinct people beyond their plots? Yes, I think I would, though we often choose to judge them in light of those plots, if not always (fan fiction, head canon etc.). I don’t want to spend too much time on this, because the nature of character is not really my main feature. I just want to be able to talk about characters as some form of constructed individual, not only to query them individually and personally, but also to query their construction.
Beings and individuals (persons), not people or humans.
“One likes to think that there is some fantastic limbo for the children of imagination, some strange, impossible place where the beaux of Fielding may still make love to the belles of Richardson, where Scott’s heroes still may strut, Dickens’s delightful Cockneys still raise a laugh, and Thackeray’s worldlings continue to carry on their reprehensible careers. Perhaps in some humble corner of such a Valhalla, Sherlock and his Watson may for a time find a place, while some more astute sleuth with some even less astute comrade may fill the stage which they have vacated.”  Arthur Conan Doyle

Partiality seems important as well; a function of perspective. As Laurel (1987) says, “characters, not people”; characters cannot attempt to be complete 1:1 simulations of real beings. Weizenbaum (1971) says that “humans… are vastly general-purpose machines”, but characters are designed for a purpose. Same with real people we meet! A person we encounter “can never supply enough details to provide me with something resembling a complete picture of his life… our personal histories are infinitely complex and ultimately unfathomable.”  And Chris Crawford “dramatic characters behave differently from real people.”

Concrete Definitions
“Figures” - Iotis Jannidis
“Word-masses” - EM Forster
An “element” (Norton, Norton and McClure, 2003) 
“Fictional personalities… one of the four main aspects of a fictional work.” (Cunnington, 2015)
“Bundles of traits, predispositions and choices that… form coherent entities” (Laurel 2013)
“Counterfeit… aspects of the human.” (McCorduck, 1979)
“Illusions” (Murray, 1997)
“Phantasms” (Plato)
“Imaginary people… nonexistents” (Walton, 1997)
“The fictional representation of a person” (Bradbury, 2006). (A ‘person’ is different from ‘human’, as we will come to look at later).

            <Title>The Quality Of Character &amp; 'Resonance'</Title>
            <Text>REFER TO ANNE AND YOCTO THROUGHOUT, AS CHARACTERS WITH QUALITIES, INTERROGABLE, DEFINABLE. WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT THEM? WE CAN’T ANSWER THIS HERE, OBVIOUSLY. BUT HERE ARE SOME WAYS TO TALK ABOUT QUALITY. OTHER EXAMPLES.
Both artists and audiences are very concerned with the ‘quality’ of character, both as a marker of ‘quality’ of its particular fictive form and as interrogable in their own right. (Recent examples of this).
Mercer (2006) - “When we engage critically with a literary work, we are not merely describing it, making it accessible to other readers; at the same time we judge it, explicitly or by implication”.
As in the Observer - “whether it’s Oliver Twist or Harry Potter, Hester Prynne or Katniss Everdeen, literary characters offer us a chance to vicariously experience life in all its drama, humor, mystery, and adventure.” 
We “come to know” characters.
(Murray) - &quot;as Forster pointed out... we are more interested in characters who are capable of surprising us than in those who are flat and predictable.&quot;
When we like a text, we “want… to make it part of our world” (Altieri)
““Great” books are, in part, considered to be great because of their cognitive value... some literature, despite being fictional, can teach readers important things about the real world” (Hepola). This is the theory of literary cognitivism. This is not necessarily her view, she is talking abstractly about literary cognitivists - does not admit to being one.
“Absorptive power” of fictional narratives.
“Sometimes a novel can affect a person’s whole identity” (Oatley)
“We would no sooner read a novel that did not move us, than an empirical articles that did not offer a validly drawn conclusion.” (Oatley)
We talk about the “impact” of narrative (Narrative Impact book)
We are “interested in the fate”  of characters (Nomura and Akai, 2012).
There are many different qualities, often pointing to different aspects of the character and its portrayal, but what about the character as a whole? What about non-specifics? (Academic context for this, or save until next section?)

The Book Group

Shadowing a book group, hear about how readers (as opposed to academics) think about characters who they have just read.

They praised character’s ‘believability’, and the author for ‘painting a picture’ (two people said this separately).
“when we discuss a novel, we must discuss its characters”

Kafka is over-descriptive, in their view; no space for the self.
They cursed some minor characters as ‘clunky devices’, others as ‘well-drawn’. They could ‘relate’ to certain characters, were “keen on” others. Some were “plausible”, others were “vivid”, even if they were “minor”. “Some where just devices that were brought in to serve a purpose and then leave”
These people, like millions of others across the world, were engaged in critical judgements of ‘quality’, very particularly not just of narratives, but of the characters which inhabited them.
The appearance of Colonel Sanders in Kafka - “unbelievable” - he “trivialised it”

￼
(My own brainstorm of qualities of characters. I am not using the term ‘literary’ anymore, as it is loaded and media-specific. These qualities (or are they techniques?) augment those below).


Words Often Used To Denote This ‘Quality’

“evocative” (Turkle, 2007);
well-written;
“sympathetic” (Oatley, 1995);
vivid;
“realistic” (Gard, 2000);
human;
“rich” (Nicolopoulou &amp; Richner, 2007);
well-shot;
“engaging” (Heidbrink, 2014);
skillfully-drawn;
“fully imagined” (Murray, 1999);
unforgettable;
“enduring” (Murran, 2016);
immortal;
“Life-like” rather than alive;
Thomas &amp; Johnson 1981 - believable characters provide an “illusion of life”
“robust” (Wawro, 2016);
evocative.

These seem to evince my previous theory of assaying characters as constructed individuals, rather than mere devices. 

A criticism of this approach is that there are many different aspects to a quality character, which differs depending on their medium and context. However, I feel that we can look generally at character, as despite differences in media, authorship and context they are broadly attempting to do different things. This links into audience reception theory and the like. They are all trying to produce an effect and affect; while the nature of these may differ, the objective remains broadly the same. I will, of course, be looking at some of these objectives more than others; which ‘resonant’ approaches I personallly find satisfying and suitable. I may need some textual backup for this idea.

Resonance

We can sum all of these up as ‘resonance’?
I define 'resonance' as those qualities of any character, in any artform, which stimulate, engage and permit interaction with the imaginative capacity of the audience. 
That which interests them, holds their attention (attention will become more important later).
I am addressing that part of characterisation that speaks to the audience.
A brief foray into the drum metaphor?
As with the book group, they painted the picture, not the author!
Based on our imagination, our senses, our remembered and current experiences.
Partiality allows resonance

- All of these terms rely on something that lies materially outside the ‘character’ as we think of it (a product of the author, publicly available in a form). It requires the vivifying input of a reader.
- In essence, the ‘reader’ of an artwork, what might be more generally called its ‘audience’, is the heart of ‘quality’. This is the focus of these metrics, and we must look at what it is about the audience, what their input is, that provides this quality. This will help us to generate it in our own work.
- Resonance comes from autocosmics - imagine and augment is in the artwork. Combination of artistic skill, the abilities and humanity of the audience. A component of reader-response theory.

[Two Irreverent Approaches To Character As Audience Simulation]

￼      
[Put this in section one?] (too irreverent?)

 ￼
[put this at the start of section two?]

COMING IN FROM AUDIENCE AS A JUDGE OF CHARACTER, AS RESONANCE BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ———&gt;
Not a new idea: well-established in the arts (many different approaches); not only that readers are ultimate judges of an artwork and its characters, but that they are part of the authoring of meaning of those artworks and characters, which relies on the reader’s subjectivity.
Reader’s Subjectivity
Gerald Prince’s Reader - “Decoder, decipherer, interpreter of… any text.” (Text in the general sense) “stressing not only the constraints imposed by the text, but also the ways in which the readers’ nature, interests, and goals partly determine the assumptions they make about texts, the questions they ask of them, the answers they formulate—and he also discussed how (narrative) texts partly read themselves, as it were, by commenting explicitly on some of their constituents”.
Texts are not just passively accepted, but actively interpreted. 
“the person’s subjectivity is important” - Laurel
“A personally imaginative result” - “not just experience but creation” - Oatley again in Narrative Impact.
Wolf also says that the recipient and their context must be taken into account (a “plurality of such contexts must always be assumed”, as well as the representation itself: they are ‘directors’ or ‘producers’ of the ‘script’ of the material representation.
“an active figure rather than a mere affective target for experience or instruction.” (Childs &amp; Fowler)
“the reader or member of the theatre audience must become an integrating centre of different streams of information”.
“We are primarily responsible for the creation of meaning when reading a literary text… represents the greatest expression of the reader’s contribution to the imagining of the world of the text”.
“In the act of reading, a text becomes a living subject within the reader.”
Maybe, then, characters are in part the sum of binary oppositions - they must be defined in opposition to their audience!
We see the importance of a character’s partiality, mentioned earlier: “Fragmentary nature of information provided in fiction.. Filling in gaps in our knowledge with hunches, ideas, feelings, or impressions” 

This Is READER RESPONSE THEORY
We have dealt with these two before, haven’t we?
Focus on the audience goes all the way back to the Greeks (Prince) Arose again, amongst literary circles, in the early 1920s (from the work of IA Richards and CS Lewis’ ‘An Experiment in Criticism’, (really into the 60s and 70s)partly as a reaction to the strength of New Criticism in America and Formalism in Russia, which was itself a reaction to a 19th century socio-political focus on author biography, demography and historical context. These formalist positions, in the view of scholars such as Erlich, separated a literature’s meaning from the psychology, sociology and intellectual history of the reader and author, making them “secondary to and dependent on purely verbal, linguistic facts.”  “Jakobson makes it clear that he rejects completely any notion of emotion as the touchstone of literature”. Warner These verbal, linguistic facts could only be found in the originating artwork.
Essays such as The Intentional Fallacy and The Affective Fallacy attempted to show the follow of relying on either the author (the intention) or the reader (the affect) as purveyors or producers of meaning.
Reader-Response, then, rejected the “objectivist position” (Rosenblatt) of New Criticism, and the idea that literature was a self-contained, self-referential object, stating that the Formalists saw meaning “as something to be deconstructed into absurdity” (Murray p5). A reader ought to be considered to “[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a ‘ready-made’ product.” (Hawkes). Fish saw the Formalists as &quot;inconclusive adducing of evidence&quot; - always arguing what a thing means, cannot seal a text off - always upset by some new corrupting influence from outside. THe influence from outside is important. 
Tied to the rise of postmodern individualism, identity politics and deconstructionist power critiques by writers such as Foucault and Barthes, leading to the orientation of readers, in the mid-20th century, from “passive… objects… to role of audiences in interpretation and evaluation”, and literature into an “affiliative joining of reader and author, or reader and characters” in “a plurality of writings-and-interpretations.” (Oatley) Not just judgements of how good it is, but the very construction of a text from its signs into an internal, imaginative meaning. Since then, many different positions have arisen, and it has moved into more general  discourses across the arts: can be called Reception Theory or Audience Response Theory more generally. (cite these terms?). For example, Susan Bennett and Brenda Laurel in theatre studies (where else?) Has even branched into communications theory and cultural studies, particularly under the auspices of Stuart Hall. “Active interpretation within relevant codes.” Asserts agency of consumer in their consumption of ‘media texts’. Modern improvements in neuroscientific methods and more advanced psychological literature have led to a melding of the two.
Criticised as anarchic subjectivism or ontological relativisim

A BRIEF DIVERSION INTO THE BOOK GROUP, PLACING MY QUOTES FROM THEM IN A READER-RESPONSE CONTEXT. JUDGING CHARACTERS, DIVULGING MEANING FROM THEIR ACTIONS, RELATING TO THEIR OWN LIVES AND EXPERIENCES, THEIR READING HISTORY (THE CULTURE), PRODUCING AND ADAPTING THEIR OWN STORIES IMAGINING MORE THAN WAS EXPLICITLY STATED. DISCUSSING CHARACTERS AS A FORM OF PLAY, REBUILDING THE WORLD. 

Relates to other, recent, reader-response work on book groups. Long found that reading groups described their discussions as 'playful', that is, creative: “they actively constructed meanings together, sometimes in joint streams-of-consciousness, based on such issues as character, identifications, and the moral qualities of the books as they related to the members' own lives” (Oatley).

Oatley also worked on reading groups: sees it as a “meeting of minds” between “reader with a book, or reader with an author.” Can be “profound.”

Says that reading groups is a way to break out of hegemony and assert importance of the reader away from cultural authority. (ref. Hall’s work).

REVIEW OF READER-RESPONSE APPROACHES 
Many different approaches, some of which are more relevant to resonance, and character, than others, as well as for the author of a creative work who wishes to use this approach to inform their practice. This is the HOW. All important for looking at character.
The Ways In Which Readers Can Respond
Cohen - Identification: “Identification is an imaginative experience in which a person surrenders consciousness of his or her own identity and experiences the world through someone else’s point of view”.
An audience member may respond by liking or disliking characters, feeling close to them (affinity; Newton &amp; Buck 1985; Newton,Buck,&amp;Woelfel,1986), finding similarities or differences between the characters and themselves (similarity; Reeves &amp; Miller, 1978), finding the characters sexually or romantically attractive (attachment; Steever, 1994), developing PSI with them (Horton &amp; Wohl,1956), or desiring to imitate them (imitation; Hoffner,1996).
The Splitting Of Narratives Into Codes Or Processes
(Prince) Reader’s ‘proairetic code’ (action sequence), ‘hermeneutic code’ (plot sequence) ‘referential’ code (context) ‘semic code’ (characters and settings (relate to my work!)) ‘symbolic code’ (meaning production and reception)
Narrative Transmission (Prince) - Real Author -&gt; Implied Author -&gt; Narrator -&gt; Narratee -&gt; Implied Reader -&gt; Real Reader
Barthes’ ‘codes for reading’ in looking at Balzac’s ‘Sarrasine’
The Persona Of The Reader
Schonert’s ‘Ideal Reader’ (the platonic reader understanding everything), Riffaterre’s ‘Superreader’ (a combination of all the text’s readers), Gibson’s ‘Mock Reader’ (1950) (a figure implied by text, a part which real readers are asked to play), Iser’s ‘Implied Reader’ (the reader “called for” by a text’s “structure of appeal” . These all rely on the reader having  “existed at least over the past few centuries of Western culture, during which the evolution of aesthetic verisimilitude and responses to illusionist art are comparatively well documented.”
Sartre said that writers write for specific readers in their time; relies on their autocosmics. For Sartre, “every concrete reader is a creator, necessary for the renewed emergence of the literary object”
Prince lists many other sorts of reader - the real reader (the flesh-and-blood person actually reading the text) and the implied reader (the equivalent of the reader’s second self or the counterpart or complement of the implied author), the ideal reader (who grasps and approves every aspect of the text), the virtual reader (for whom the real author believes s/he is writing and to whom s/he assigns various characteristics and abilities) and such interpretive notions as superreaders, informed readers, or competent readers.
Genette’s ‘narratee’ - “Narratees should be distinguished from real, implied, or other kinds of readers. The narratee is the audience (of one or more than one) that the narrator in a given narrative addresses. It is constituted and signified by textual signs of the “you” narrated to…” (Prince?)
Walton calls them ‘appreciators’.
Wolf talks about the ‘average’ recipient.
Eco’s ‘model reader’ - the text models the reader implicitly.
Wolf - It would be possible to continue with this profile of the optimal reader, but I would not get very far before someone would point out that what I am really describing is the intended reader, the reader whose education, opinions, concerns, linguistic competences, etc. make him capable of having the experience the author wished to provide. 
Importance Of The Author
As Stanley Fish says in Affective Stylistics - no text without reader (trained by them, but was a reader-response guy)  “in that its significant structures are not given but ascertained by prior interpretive procedures that are always already in place”, usually as part of “interpretative communities” rather than the authority of the reader.
Barthes “proclaimed the author’s death and the reader’s birth as the locus of textual meaning,” - no author, but audience. Barthes - “a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination” disagree with him over the idea of reader as impersonal however. (Death Of The Author)
Some Reader-Response people take a mixed view: Iser says that works have both unwritten and written parts. He distinguishes between “concretization by the reader, and the work of art resulting from their convergence”. Argues that a text guides the production of meaning, through schema, constraints and directions, while leaving gaps to be filled through the audience’s sensemaking. The aesthetic object comes out of this. (All from Childs &amp; Fowler).
Meaning is not inherent in text itself, but is created out of relationship,  a “special kind of meeting” between author and audience. - Oatley. Rommetveit - “temporarily shared social reality” between writer, text and reader, Thurgar-Dawson’s reciprocal spatial realities. “Geography, and indeed textual geography, does indeed space; it causes a new space to be formed both on the page and in the mind of the reader, it is spacially performative, not merely constative or mimetic”. 
“Writing is only half an act. The full act is writing and reading.” - Oatley
“Research does not support the claim that readers necessarily receive messages intended by authors” (Sklar, from Narvaez).
Transactional Reader-Response Theory - like videogames. Two meanings that come together 
A “bi-active” model - the text controls some of the response and the reader controls the rest. Is all reader-response generally bi-active?
A almost political, oppositional model - Eco’s ‘aberrant encoding’, Hall’s encoding/decoding model - ‘preferring’ reading, ‘dominant readings, ‘negotiated readings. ‘Oppositional’ readings. A politicised edge to reader-response theory. Assumes that dominant reading is hegemonic.  A “rhetoric of contestation” from Barthes - the reader resists the supposed meaning of a text and produces their own.


We’ve done the HOW - WHY does this happen? Why does reader-response theory make sense, to what is it pointing? What is it that the author is courting? All important for looking at character. The phenomenology of a text - how readers concretise by turning “a mere series of sentences into an aesthetic object”

Lots of terms for it (’imagination’, ‘assimilation’, ‘accommodation’, ‘absorption’ (Cohen 2001), “immersion” (Ryan 1991, Schaeffer 1999), “involvement” and “psychological participation” (Walton 1990), “transportation” (Gerrig 1993), Green, Brock, Kaufman - “transportation” ‘abstraction’ (Hugill &amp; Yang)  ) - most precise term, within a narratological context, is ‘aesthetic illusion’ (Werner Wolf) - “a basically pleasurable mental state that emerges during the reception of many representational texts, artifacts or performances…elicited by a conjunction of factors that are located (a) in the representations themselves, (b) in the reception process and the recipients, and (c) in framing contexts, e.g. cultural-historical, situational and generic ones.”  This suits us as it places the author and the reader in a relationship, working towards what we might call Iser’s “aesthetic object”.

Refers to lots of different activities that we undertake with characters in narratives, such as Kaufman and Libby’s (2012) “experience-taking”  with its “reduced sense of self-concept”, Hayakawa’s insistence that ‘reading lets you live many lives’. Kratka’s “identification” (Others?)

Wolf cites the start of aesthetic illusion in the 6th-4th centuries BC in greece - &gt; art went from magical and religious to purely aesthetic. 

“The ability to interpret is not acquired; it is constitutive of being human.” (Fish). “A writer makes his marks not to provoke a response, but because he knows a response will be provoked.” It is natural, but is induced by reading.  Individuals do not have to be taught to become immersed in stories.

&quot;visibility&quot; = &quot;imagination&quot; - he devotes an entire essay to it! &quot;The mental cinema is always at work in each one of us... [it never] stop[s] projecting images before our mind's eye.&quot; The mind’s camera is as important as a film character. &quot;In devising a story, therefore, the first thing that comes to my mind is an image that for some reason strikes me as charged with meaning&quot;

Closely related to Zwaan’s ‘situation model’ - “mental representations of the state of affairs described in a text rather than of the text itself.”

Aesthetic illusion is not restricted to narratives, as illustrated by important forms of non-narrative illusionist painting (portraits, still lives, genre scenes, landscape painting, etc.), though the 19th century realist novel produced the height of aesthetic illusion, in Wolf’s opinion (hence why so many Dickens, Flaubert etc. characters appear on ‘best character lists’). Nonetheless, “aesthetic illusion is therefore a transmedial, transmodal and transgeneric phenomenon.” 



Features Of Aesthetic Illusion
Suspension Of Disbelief (from Coleridge originally)
&quot;human propensity to suspend disbelief in the presence of a persuasive dramatic presence&quot; (Murray)
“Total delusion is rarely achieved (we do not rush on stage to whisper in the tragic hero’s ear) and would probably be psychologically damaging.” (Childs &amp; Fowler).
“Both readers and writers conspire to create often-unpredictable outcomes”
Wolf’s ‘Reception Contract’
Nell The “reading trance”
“Guided Projection” (1960) (Gombrich)
Zwaan - “Much of the research on situation models in narrative comprehension suggests that comprehenders behave as though they are in the narrated situation rather than outside of it.”
Celare artem - maintain the conceit that it is real (Wolf)
Hilgrard compared reading to hypnosis
Approaches a fictional work “with the intention of inducing an (aesthetic) experience”, then when in it “simultaneously disengage his awareness of the work’s fictionality… [imbued with] the sensation of realism”
References Scheff’s scale of aesthetic distance; how strongly do we feel the artwork?
Amie Thomasson’s ‘internal’ and ‘external’ contexts for talking about characters. As real or as fictional.
Hepola taking the fictional realism perspective ““involves a certain amount of pretense.”
&quot;second-order&quot; beliefs - suspension of disbelief.
Wittig’s ‘meaning system’ - bring their own lives into it. Narvaez’s ‘schemas’
Not suspension of disbelief but the “generation of temporary belief” (Childs &amp; Fowler).
Nell (1988) studied people who read at least one book a week for pleasure. He made recordings from the autonomic nervous systems and facial muscles of these subjects as they read books of their choice. He found high physiological arousal, but subjects also reported a trance-like satisfaction.
Metaphors, similes, descriptions have us simulate those spaces and smells and experiences vividly.
Self-reinforcing: Gardner &amp; Knowles (2009) - facourite characters are anthropomorphised more. 
Strong enough that we can feel their ‘presence’. Small reference to social presence. Schubert, Friedmann, &amp; Rogenbrecht’s 2001 presence scale. parasocial relationships - shoemaker etc.
an 'illusion of intimacy' -Horton &amp; Wohl
A fiction is a mental structure (Vaihinger, Kermode etc.)

This has led to what has been called ‘the paradox of fiction’ (Colin Radford, 1975)
That is, why do we seem to feel real emotion about beings which we know do not exist in real life? Our reaction to fiction is irrational. Schneider thinks they are real emotions. Since then, “inconsistency and incoherence”. &quot;various debates... continue to rage.&quot;
Aesthetic illusion seems to be at its heart, but the qualities of the emotions that it generates has been under scrutiny for over 50 years.
Sklar’s approach - he sees the “‘real/fictional’ dichotomy” as false  - we “bring many of the same intuitions and forms of evaluation to our encounters with fictional characters that we use with real people”. Characters have an “imaginative reality”… “imagined as… real individuals with distinct realities”. Readers take experiences with fictional characters into their lives which “suggest[s] that they regard the emotions that they are feeling while reading as something more than fiction” “We respond… emotionally to fictional characters, whom we regard intuitively as real people”.
Kendall Walton, a Pretend Theorist - they are ‘quasi-emotions’ - we are consciously ‘playing’ at being emotional with the story. They are not substantially different from real emotions - what they differ in is their source. They can be real emotions, but not (responding in ‘Spelunking and Slime’.) Like child’s play. “Participation in make-believe… is itself a form of mental simulation.”  “In simulating, one’s psychological mechanisms are being run “off line… they are disconnected from some of their usual behavioural manifestations.” “Appreciators do not literally pity Willy Loman, grieve for Anna Karenina, and admire Superman.” This does not, in her view, lower the quality or importance of these emotions. Uses the metaphor of a car on a track with the screen of a mountain road behind it. Walton assumes a deliberate edge to aesthetic illusion. Kendall Walton thinks it isn’t important that we don’t really believe in what we see (unlike Sklar, who believes we do. Walton bemoans the “undue emphasis” on this point). I think she sees that “magic circle” theory is the most important. 

Hartz and Novitz both pointed out that art-lovers don't believe that they are 'pretending' emotions - they believe they are really having them. Walton says that the acceptance of the 'game' may be tacit - we do not realise that our emotions are not real.

Simo Saatela - startle effect in films - we are not pretending those. They are real, just &quot;mistaken identification&quot; - our body thinks the thing is real, at a certain level, before we consciously recognise that it is not). can't account for every emotion, however, but maybe just those very basal ones (what Hartz calls &quot;pre-conscious&quot;) such as startle, gag reflex etc. Those ones tied to body - embodied theory of mind.

We are moved by fiction - just not to real fear

Thought Theory - don't need something to exist for us to feel emotion for it. Peter Lamarque says that we only need to &quot;represent&quot; &quot;entertain in thought&quot; (carroll), R.T. Allen - &quot;truth is not confined to the factual&quot;. Not frightened by the representation, but the simulation in my mind. Radford said that we are still, then, frightened by fictional thoughts.

Turvey attacks Thought Theory in relation to film - ignores the concrete image on the screen, privileging the mental simulation. Certainly might make sense for film, (maybe return to it in section 2?)

Therefore fiction fits the aesthetic illusion idea best because it is entirely symbolic, rather than pictoral? Need to address this. Turvey moves towards a hybridity - that there may be intermediate stages where we can &quot;entertain&quot; the concrete image within us without converting it into a fully-blown simulation. 

Thought Theory can't explain WHY mere thoughts move us.

Counterpart Theory - the real emotions we feel when we read fiction is because we are thinking about real people like that, or possible people.

Where do I lie on this spectrum? I think somewhere in the middle, closer to thought theory, but the idea of active participation is important as well, of 'play'.

The paradox shows how powerful these mental simulations are. The stickiness of the debate helps us artists.

This 'reality' of emotions moves us into our reactions to mental simulations outside of literature, outside of fully-conscious, fictional simulation. 

Susan Feagin - pretending to care for fictional characters would not make sense, would it?

Magic Circle (lead on from Walton’s ideas)
“literature may help us to recognize and explore our fantasies without giving way to them” (Childs &amp; Fowler)
Formalists agreed that literature was set apart from everyday speech.
Oatley and Gholamain - “we can concentrate on our emotions and reflect on them in a safe place away from the ordinary world”
Brecht’s idea of catharsis - out of ‘magic circle’ and back into the real world.
- What Hepola calls “according to the story” (a predicate modifier) is a magic circle. Different from simpliciter properties.
Gibson’s ‘mock reader’.
Nell points out the inherent safety of narrative worlds - the magic circle.
We will come back to talk about this more in later chapters.
Conclusion
The idea of a character’s ‘resonance’, their most important and generic feature, arises out of the responses of the audience, which has a lengthening importance in literary and art theory. There are many different approaches to the reader’s response, all of which have some interest to the artist trying to create better characters artistically: ‘generating interest, and in particular emotional interest, in the represented world’, or ‘render representations attractive and keep distance at a minimum.’. The response of the audience, that which we are trying to court, arises out of their imaginative and mental capacities, what Wolf calls ‘aesthetic illusion’. This leads to the powerful responses to art which are at the centre of our culture, and which lead to the augmentation, some may say creation, of character. To design characters well, then, for an artist, is to build a character that courts this imaginative faculty. Despite this, Wolf points out, it has received “amazingly scant attention in research”. It’s also a difficult thing to calculate, because of the great variety of human psychology out there (“personal cosmologies” - Darill, Mergenthal, Gidders), and despite the attempts of scholars to codify ‘the reader’ into an ideal being. “These variables make it difficult, if not impossible, to decide on the actual illusionist effect of a given work, text, technique, etc. for all periods and all individuals.” Complicated by the author as reader, and critic as reader, human readers with their own faculties, as well. Also whether deliberate or accidental.
However, aesthetic illusion is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the human imaginative capacity: Childs &amp; Fowler point out that ‘fiction’, what we think of as writing imaginatively, is in fact more suited to the very act of imagination in the first place, an act which transcends the bounds of art: “All mental activity, it is claimed, is fictional because it involves shaping material which is inherently shapeless. We can only make sense of things by imposing fictions (shapes or interpretations) on them. ‘Fiction’ thus becomes a kind of umbrella, sheltering many different kinds of mental activity and cultural.”  “immersion seems to satisfy a powerful psychological predisposition“ This is unsurprising, considering reader-response criticisms close ties with psychology.Character as psychological mordant. It is important to look at these faculties, which we will do so next.
Not necessarily offerings answers, but &quot;a straightforward acceptance of something mysterious about human nature (our ability to be moved by what we know does not exist is illogical, irrational, even incoherent).
Norton, Norton and McClure - &quot;characterization is one of the most powerful literary elements&quot; - more so than the others re. Formalism.
&quot;Plot only exists because of character&quot; - Donald Graves - rather than the other way around. Roser, Martinez et. al(2007)
Calvino distinguishes aesthetic illusion from everyday illusion (re. wolf) using the term &quot;high fantasy&quot; - loftier part of the imagination.</Text>

            <Text>Defining This ‘Low Fantasy’

What does literary fantasising, this particular mental faculty, lie in opposition to, in Wolf’s eyes?
It is everything that relates to the human ability to create ‘illusion’ (I.e. to create mental simulations) outside of the purely artistic.
A very, very large topic, covering one of the most important, distinguishing and widespread human faculties, of which aesthetic illusion is just one subset, distinguished by the need for a “inciting representation”; in distinction to this is what Wolf somewhat dismisses as “delusions”, “conceptual and perceptual errors”, “hallucinations” and “dreams”. While art is very interested in these things as subjects (examples from art?), the role of such things in art are often set aside. Such things are more the purview of psychological, psychoanalytical and neuroscientific literature.
However, there is, I hope to show here, much crossover; much of what we could consider “non-literary” mental simulation can have inciting representations, often deliberate (advertising, for example), but often accidental and unformalised. Often, we might argue, what distinguishes it is the  direct “phenomenology of our experiences” (Walton), rather than being parsed through a text. Not always, however. Can be within its own magic circle, can be participatory with which Huizinga called “the play attitude”, but often is forced upon us, or seems real: not defined by the “ambivalence” or deliberate participation which is, according to Wolf, part of the aesthetic illusion. Can often be part of the warp and weft of our lives, more deeply embedded, or afforded less sacred significance and space, than art itself.

“Make-believe and imagining are pervasive in human experience, by no means confined to our interactions with works of fiction… fiction [is] continuous with the rest of life.” (Walton, S&amp;S). 

&quot;The mental cinema is always at work in each one of us... [it never] stop[s] projecting images before our mind's eye.&quot; (Calvino) The mind’s 


A Nominal Definition

As with aesthetic illusion, there are many terms used to describe this faculty. It is not in the remit to discuss them all, merely draw them together in review. Very commonly it is called “imagination” (a citation?), “simulation” (a citation?) or “modelling” (a citation?), or many other things besides. Each of these have both specific and general meanings within different fields, which can muddy our high-level examination of the entirety of the phenomenon. For example, imagination is used in psychology to mean “all mental simulation”, as we mean it, as well as precisely to mean the simulation of prior sensory experiences.
Because of this, and to distinguish our transdisciplinary interest, I will be using a nominal definition, a term around which we can talk, and which we can use to stand for our general interest, whether aesthetic or mundane, incited or sourceless, deliberate or accidental, in the human hallucinatory faculty as an object of interest for artists.
The term I have chosen is AUTOCOSMICS. This means “self-worlds”, which I think captures the internalised, personal nature of mental simulation, as well as their immersiveness, as well as pointing to their atmospheric osmosis; how other mental faculties, and the world outside the self, can affect and influence them, like meteorites scarring the face of a world. The word ‘cosmos’, as well, to me stands for a system in tension, an interpolation of many moving parts, rather than the rather static “imagination”, which also confines us to the purely visual: though this is important, it is not the only way to ‘imagine’. We could have used the word ‘simulation’, which I think also preserves these qualities, but again its numerous popular and specific meanings make life difficult for us. Autocosmics, in being new and nominal, does not place any prior judgement or distinction between “high” and “low” fantasy, its source or purpose, only the fact of its existence as a phenomenon, its role within the individual, its varying degrees of immersion and its constant systemic evolution within a mind. I must admit to adapting it from another pleasing term, paracosm, used (but not coined) extensively by the developmental psychologist Marjorie Taylor to describe the detailed fictional worlds of both children, lunatics and artists. This cross-generational divide is a nice touch, as is the non-judgemental ascription to all human mental activity, which I feel is preserved in my term. 
This account, then, in referring to “autocosmics” in general, might be accused of being an act of “intellectual hubris”  (an attempt to theorise everything, and thus nothing); but I am not trying to unite all mental simulation, or provide a grand theory, or link everything together; I merely want to draw attention to its ubiquity, and the different ways that it has been both courted, ignored and modified by different fields, with the concluding goal of looking outside my own disciplinary boundaries at other examples of this loose collection of human abilities.


Where Does It Come From?

[[This section might need more theoretical grounding]].

In plain English, from a combination of the mind and the body.

The power of the human brain as a computational object, to compute both internally to itself (memory, for example (cite)), and externally to the bodily. It is arguable whether mental simulation can be thought of as ever entirely mental: phenomenologists such as Andy Clark states that much of our cognition is out in the world (”extended cognition”). Merleau-Ponty talked about “the flesh of the world”, and Shapiro traces changes in more recent history from a “comfortably Cartesian view[s] of mind.&quot; To “the mind incarnate” (Shapiro).

David Deutsch - “it is uncontroversial that the human brain has capabilities that are, in some respects, far superior to those of all other known objects in the cosmos.” 

The processing of that information takes place within our brains: this is an evolutionary impulse.  Holland - “General abilities based in the brain and shared by all human beings who have normal brains.”

It relies in general on two major components of mankind’s biology and psychology: the gathering of information and its processing, either in conjunction or merely processing. “Man… is… a receiver and transmitter of information… transforms the distillate of his world into memories, mental imagery… an information processor.” (Weiz p140).  
“The ability to interpret is not acquired; it is constitutive of being human.”   Stanley Fish
What, at base, we try to do is make sense of this flood of sensory and mental data, constantly churning and changing all the time, which “stimulate people to look for causal connections.”  As Donald Norman says, “the human mind is exquisitely tailored to make sense of the world”; we are “explanatory creatures” (cite?) who “assimilate reality into systems of transformations” ; mental systems that mean manipulating the raw data into internalised sense-made projections. This comes back the idea of accidental/deliberate; though we can deliberately tweak and make sense of certain things in certain ways, often it is accidental and uncontrolled: “give it the slightest clues and off it goes, providing explanation, rationalisation, understanding” . Very similar to the “integrative coherence” of aesthetic illusion from Wolf, in which the reader parses the text with their own lives. This is “reproductive imagination” (cite); reproducing (always partially) the data we receive from the world. This is contrasted with “constructive imagination”, or is in partnership with it; using the computational power of the brain to take existing concepts and build new ones out of them, or adapt mental constructs of sensory/bodily/worldly data and change them into something else. 
Indeed, this sense-making leads us to a wider use of the term ‘narrative’; a “mode of mental life” (Oatley)  as a sequence of consistent events which are relatable and trackable, temporal and causal. It is how we explain the past, predict the future, and plot the present in continuum, give meaning to our existence and determine patterns over a long period of time. It has led, arguably, to the modern practices of science; placing what we know into an experimental mental mode, applying that to the outside world, and comparing the two. Science requires creative leaps combined with this inquisitiveness and pattern-matching ability, which has led to most of our most breathtaking advances as a species (who talks about this?), and have shaped our complex social natures, as well as coordinating the simplest of our higher (and lower) functions. “Narrative [is] the most important cognitive macro-frame man has developed to make sense of experience in and of time” (Wolf).





 [[Is there a specific example of this which demonstrates all these concepts? Of both taking data from the world, and adapting existing mental constructs, both deliberately and accidentally, into an explanatory narrative which also relates to our interest in characters?]]

EMPATHY!
A big subject of debate amongst reader-response theorists and psychologists.
Taking the view of another. Chris Allen Thomas - “empathy is the ability of people to recognise and respond to the emotions of others”. M.H. Davis - empathy is the “reactions of one individual to the observed experiences of another.” - “simulates what is going on in another person’s mind” (Feagin).
Different from sympathy, which is the emotional response to the emotional experiences of another as other, as opposed to empathy, which involves a degree of perspective-taking; of understanding not just the situation externally, but the mental situation internally. Relates to German term Einfuhlung (”feeling into”). Dunn (1988) states that maybe it is difficult to separate these two states.
(Margaret Morris) Either cognitive Empathy - deliberate “perspective taking”, or emotional empathy, which is mostly-unconscious sharing of emotions due to emotional contagion. 
Relies entirely on the ability to simulate the minds of the other, a “theory of mind” or what Alison Lee calls “mentalising”. and can produce very strong emotional responses (similar to emotion in fiction, though actually based on reality?). Part of what Davies &amp; Stone call “folk psychological practice”, “a practice in which we all engage on an everyday basis.”
Required because of the hard problem of consciousness, the inaccessibility of other minds (citation?) - tied to qualia (introduced by CI Lewis in 1929) - “the subjective or qualitative properties of experiences.” (Kind), including “perceptual experiences, bodily sensations, felt reactions and emotions and felt moods” . These are very difficult to study, and their existence has caused “considerable controversy in philosophy of mind” (Kind).
BIOLOGICAL BASIS - Kohler (infants gain self-objectification and empathy at 2); Farrow et. Al (2001) and Oschner et. Al (2004) found the precuneus and prefrontal cortex and left superior frontal gyrus as important for empathy.
Vogeley &amp; Fink (2003) - Precuneus (in the brain) is associated with the taking of perspectives, both first-person and spatial third-person, with differental activation in the bilateral precuneus when first-person (because of agency?), though Alison Lee is not sure whether this is the source of mental imagery, or the mechanism by which we understand the perspectives of others.
Very, very important to human society. “The importance of empathy is indisputable because it plays a vital role in human social behavior as well as in the behavior of some non-human species” (Rodrigues et al.) Frans de Vaal - a “mammalian characteristic” -&gt; communicate at an emotional level with our pets. Emotional empathy in voles. Goes against the idea that everything is based on selfish motives in the animal kingdom (in his book Empathy: Its Ultimate &amp; Proximal Bases), and opens up intriguing debates on theory of mind in animals. Some see it, however as HIS autocosmics.
Humphrey and Crook - social animals need cues. -”probably has an innate basis” - “we are designed by natural selection to assume that other people have similar mental experiences to ourselves”. So, social interdependence leads to the need for simulation.






Extensions Of Audience Response Theory Into Psychology (Overlap of “High” Fantasy &amp; “Low” Fantasy)

Childs &amp; Fowler - “Since I. A. Richards’s Principles of Literary Criticism (1924), critics have usually been wary of detailed explorations into reader psychology: ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ (Coleridge) is now more often alluded to than investigated.” - this is not true at all! Massive link between reader-response theory and psychology.

“What is more, improvements in psychology and neuroscience have lent even more credence to the reader-response position, as we are now able to offer scientific proof – the 'facts' that the Formalists were so keen on – as to what is happening in an audience's mind when they engage with a literary work.” (Literature &amp; The Brain, 2009)

Gerrig's work - &quot;that fiction... has the same status that illusions have for psychologists interested in perception”.

Not all reader-response theorists are like Childs &amp; Fowler and Wolf - Holland Interested in the difference between individual responses, and how wider human responses to things coincided with literary responses. He talks about dreams, and slips of the tongue.


         ————————————————————————————————————————————————— ——————————

We see here that there is a lot of (and increasing) overlap between the study of psychology and the study of literature: important discoveries are made linking general principles of mental simulation and specific aesthetic illusion. An interesting conclusion from it: Reader is not all-powerful, as some reader-response theory categorises them - subject to powerful outside forces and internal forces (autocosmics), and they bring many of their wider autocosmic faculties into their appreciation of art. The degree to which this happens, and the extent of similarity between “real-world” autocosmics and “art-world” autocosmics is still a subject of debate. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

NeuroImage 2006 study and Emory University 2012: the brain lights up areas that deal with texture and smell when dealing with descriptions, metaphors and similes that employ these techniques. Words like “lavender,” “cinnamon” and “soap,” for example, elicit a response not only from the language-processing areas of our brains, but also those devoted to dealing with smells.
Motor cortex stimulated when reading about physical activity (Boulenger study)
Mar (2011) - fMRI studies - overlap between reading about stories and parts of brain used for interpersonal interaction.
Nicolopoulos &amp; Richner - “Results indicated that children's representation of characters shifted from almost exclusively physical and external portrayals of &quot;actors&quot; at 3 to increasing inclusion of &quot;agents&quot; with rudimentary mental states at 4 and of &quot;persons&quot; with mental representational capacities by 5.”  Their method involved splitting ‘character’ from ‘plot’ development. “Misleading” previous research putting this ability much later in children.
Simo Saatela’s look at the Startle Effect in film (her disputation of the Paradox of Fiction) and its “mistaken identification” with real fear and danger.
Cohen’s comparisons of “identification with media characters” with identification in “other interpersonal contexts… such as stories heard around a campfire or at a slumber party, or in highly emotional interpersonal conversations, such as in support groups.”
Emory University - A compelling novel causes changes in the brain - heightened activity in regions of the brain associated with physical sensation and movement when reading something with a dramatic plot.
Directs In Empirical Literary Studies (2008) - reading prose by Chekhov is different from reading documentary-style text with the same context. “By projecting ourselves into fictional stories and the minds of fictional characters, we open ourselves up to greater possibilities for who we may become.”
Kid &amp; Castano - reading literature improves intuitive abilities.
Peter Bazalgette - the arts promote empathy.
Oatley &amp; Mar (2006 and 2007) - reading fiction makes you more empathetic.
Calvino writes about qualia, and posits that it may be the basis for all writing - &quot; [to] give speech to that which has no language&quot; 
Norman Holland looked at psychoanalytic psychology.
Working with Reading Groups: (Holland, Richard Long, “playful” discussions -  &quot;they actively constructed meanings together, based on such issues as character, identifications, and the moral qualities of the books as they related to the member's own lives.&quot; Keith Oatley’s work with reading groups,  a &quot;profound... meeting of minds&quot;. Bleich's symbolisation and resymbolisation tests - no objective reading, based on their own experiences. Steig and Slatoff's experimentations. Berman looks at emotively-charged discussion - kind of like therapy.
Cohen links empathy creation with identification with media characters - part of the emotional learning of children.
Discover the phonology (the sounds of names) allow you to discriminate the roles of characters.
Name of character predicts their role - like bouba/kiki.
Miall and Kuiken use techniques from neuropsychology.
Heart Rate test - hear rate change when listing to a story. language regions and auditory regions are triggered. No distinction in body between real and unreal.
In fact, lots of cross-over. Very related to psychology, and has been linked to psychological advances, particularly post-behaviourists



Quick Conclusion

“Psychological processes do not happen in books but in people” - a character’s resonance, for an audience member, is inextricably tied to their wider autocosmic faculties.

Autocosmics, then, is not what lies outside literature: it is the sum of the human faculty of mental simulation and virtuality, of which Wolf’s “aesthetic illusion” is a part. Indeed, it is scalar, part of a continuum, and the distinctions between mundane narrative cognition and aesthetic narrative cognition are less clear than perhaps Wolf makes out, or perhaps, if not less clear, then less relevant. The distinction between aesthetic and mundane, real and fictional, true emotion and quasi-emotion, is difficult to countenance, and battles rage on. What seems to be true in the recent psychology/literary theory/neuroscience corssovers is that 
art is  &quot;emotionally potent... a kind of emotional truth that we experience at a biochemical level&quot;.  “On a neurobiological level, our experience of consuming fiction is actually very real.”
Narrative is not a faculty unique, or even necessarily originating in, art: it is something which we have always used to interpret the world around us, and our own minds and its constructs. Character, as a concept, is something which transcends literature as well: it is part of our experience of narrative, it is how we make sense of and compartmentalise the acts and supposed thoughts of other agents.
We therefore, as artists trying to create good characters, create ‘resonance’ through the courting of the entire autocosmic faculty of human beings; of understanding the links between a character portrayed on screen and the piece of hay blowing across a car park which looks like a spider; the similarities between relating to other real people and written people; the wider context of these supposedly delimited imaginations which are our object of study and artifice. This holds much interest to us; this context of pattern-matching, narratisation, sense-making etc, across human culture, not just art. Perhaps then art will not only speak of human culture and human cognition; it will court it more widely, in a formal sense, in their audiences as well. 
There are many, many fields of research which I have taken inspiration from in this sense, and where I can show elements of narrative or artistic interest where perhaps there is not a great deal of interest already [the big list]. Perhaps the most important example for my narrative, however, is that of superstition, and religion: key to Yocto’s narrative, and Anne’s. An example of human autocosmics not relating to objective fact, of being irrational. Here, the narrative importance and interest, both inside and out, is most keenly seen; in the disconnect between the objective outside world and how it is parsed, reproduced and constructed by the human imagination. It is these “errors” which offer much aesthetic potential.</Text>

Back to anne and yocto.
This is where partiality comes back in.
Therefore, judging character comes down to the personal response of the audience. 


My nominal definition of “autocosmics”, with its wide remit, comes I think from the need to show the importance of both cultured and non-cultured imaginative acts by an audience in the construction of an artwork for them.



“in common usage it has a very equivocal sense, more often than not trivial, even derogatory – ‘it’s all in your imagination’. But as soon as it is associated with any form of art it becomes an indication of value. The extremes meet in the distrust of Art as the enemy of common sense, decency, reason, good government or sound business.”

The link between specific artistic simulation and everyday daydreaming - this is reall important
 “A writer makes his marks not to provoke a response, but because he knows a response will be provoked.”



Rhetoric - transferring emotions, this is what we are all about.

Superstition

A very ancient (and very current!) form of human autocosmics: the attribution of causality to unknown or unrelated forces through cultural naivety or norms.
“False causality is the basis for much superstition.”
Speak a little about religion in general, but not too much. (Will speak more in Chapter 3) -  “powerful manifestations of our own fears and hopes and dreams. The invention - the finding within of gods represents our reach for the transcendent.”
“The word has long been used in a derogatory sense to describe what were perceived to be unfounded, credulous or heretical beliefs. Ancient Roman and Greek authors applied it to ‘uncivilised’ people outside the Classical world. The early Church used it in its campaign against the pagan religions which it ultimately vanquished.”

“In the past gave order to a chaotic and unpredictable world.”
Opie’s chronicle its prevalence amongst children - call it ‘half-belief’ (a nod to magic circles/consensus).
Religion



KORAN NOTES

Pareidolia of holy books - in the mouth of fod.
Koran is a character study of god. 
His power is reinforced constantly.
“Whereever you are” - universality.
“A book of guidance with proofs of guidance distinguishing right from wrong”
Speaking directly to the believer. 
“People of the book” - jews and christians
“None denies it except the evil transgressor who, when Our revelations are recited to him, cries ‘fables of the ancients’!”
“The slinking prompter”
All holy books are very concerned with unbelievers - autocosmics must go further, for them.
“An apostle from God reciting from purified pages infallible (truths)”
“Are you harder to create than the heaven  which he has built”
“No, your compatriot is not mad. He saw him on the clear horison.
“But the record of the righteous shall be in Illiyun. Would that you knew what Illiyun is! It is a sealed book, seen only by the favoured.”
Non-linear structure - a literary device, some say, representing the shattering of human language. (Michael Sells)
An incredible work of autocosmics, ascribed to its main character.
Lots of prescriptions of right times.
Muhammad is an unseen “sum of oppositions” (Lotman) character in the text- he is dictated to.
Constant character reinforcement - “god is self-sufficient and wise”.
A constant plea for believability! Against the unpredictability of autocosmics.
Koran like Arbatel - co-opts past books into versimilitude.
The Apostles are characters, and minor characters. Litterally the Koran means “The recitation”.
A “lost text”, starting with Adam - alternate accounts of other holy books.
Also called “The mother book”.
It changes throughout his life - softens towards the end.


Ritualised communication - can’t just have a chat with the god.

Prayer is an interesting example of autocosmic suggestion - you ask for a certain thing, and are in the performative frame of mind for something to occur.

Tambiah argues that magical language violates the first principle of language (communication) like game’s relations to real life - characters/stories? But must be grounded in the real, in the human.


Case Study: Anne &amp; Yocto’s Time Period

The ‘Enlightenment’

Often called “the long 18th century” because of the perceived change in social, political and personal identities from 1700 to 1800. Anne is placed right in the middle.
Keith Thomas was the first point of academic reference in 70s - said magic ‘declined’ in 18th century. Fits with Enlightenment narrative. De Bleacourt and other recent scholars dispute this.
“It was appropriated as an Enlightenment tool, and added to the arsenal of words used to enforce a self-conscious intellectual and cultural break with the past.”
“It is too crude and misleading to portray the Enlightenment as a period of intellectual and social leaps”
“Yet the majority of people across Europe undoubtedly felt exactly the same about witches, and much else besides, whether they lived in the early seventeenth century or the early nineteenth century.”
Considered a benighted time.
Davies &amp; de Blecourt (BTWT) “so-called enlightenment”
BTWT that it continued for centuries, despite the enlightenment.
Brian Hoggard - “continuation and survival of witchcraft practices”
“The decline of magic was a slow and long drawn-out affair.”



“Intellectually the whole basis for witchcraft and magic was being questioned.”
Gap between complex ambivalence of popular culture and the simplistic dichotomy preached by the church in relation to spirits.

Perceived Difference Between Elites And Poor

Even in the assertion that there was a sharp divide between the uneducated and elites, there was a “subtler renegotiation between cultures”.
“It was also a label applied to the cultures of the ‘lower orders’ as a means of clearly demarcating the world of the ‘ignorant’ from the educated, the ‘irrational’ from the rational. In this sense ‘superstition’ became the antithesis of modernity.”
The elite and the people often believed the same thing, but there were class-defined manifestations of superstition.
Dyer (BTWT) asserts that medical practice and belief was tinged by religious belief, spiritualism, and a partly-shared (or at least empathised) autocosmic framework between patients and doctors; therefore, the possessions were not merely dismissed as medical rather than spiritual.
BTWT account of Dyer (Bristol) - the supposedly ‘enlightened’ middle classes took part in spiritualism.
Bristol essay in BTWT states that public discourse does not necessarily reflect private belief. 
Ran counter to the supposed ‘enlightenment’ tone of intellectual life at that period.
Setting up an interview with the spirit, testing it with scratches.
“In yet another sense, the women involved in the case were pursuing a path independent of their male advisers, challenging not only their understanding of what was happening in spiritual terms but also their preferred human solutions.”
“The public world still offered many cultural resources to justify the opinions of Dyer and his circle, if properly deployed.”
“A simple dichotomy between ‘believers’ and ‘sceptics’ fails to do justice to the range of both convictions and doubts about what was happening and how best to react to it which could be felt by those involved.”
“It was still possible, as I hope I have shown, to justify beliefs in witchcraft, even on enlightened principles. Yet the price to be paid for doing so, in terms of the spiritual priorities of those who might have sought to defend the reality of witchcraft, was increasingly one that did not seem worth paying.”
Davies’ demographic breakdown of visitors to cunning folk; many rich and educated people.
Priests becoming cunning folk.

“Ancient apprehensions… continue to infiltrate their minds”

Influence Of Witch Trials

May be because of the witch trials, and the period after them being seen as uninteresting, secular, or more educated. Historians have in general ignored the post-trial years.
Ref. The Witchcraft Act 1736 (a generation before Anne) but &quot;cunning folk seem to have been virtually immune from legal harrassment&quot;

Popular Magic

Superstition could be grouped under ‘popular magic’. Distinguished from ‘high magic’.
 &quot;the world of popular belief and custom... practical remedies for specific problems&quot;
Less scholarship (See ‘Context’ under ‘Creative Work’)

Consensus

Dyer (BTWT) asserts that from the sufferer’s perspectives, it was an autocosmic maelstrom both informed by their supernatural beliefs and social/familial expectations - the cunning-person allowed ‘blessed relief’ - a consensual end to the autocosmics.
(Dyer) “One explanation of the growing scepticism evident by early March is that this factor, and the lack of any further new dramatic developments, led all concerned to feel dissatisfied.” - the narrative runs dry.

Familiars (Just Like Yocto!)

Dyer (BTWT) - “it appears pretty evident that the poor wretch has a familiar to attend her”
“Substances such as ale or milk were often poured on springs, trees and rocks sacred to fairies, while bowls of bread, milk or water and suchlike were left in the kitchen overnight for the domestic hobman”


“This old hag travelled with a Guinea pig in her breast, which she pretended solved questions” - autocosmic pets

Cunning Folk (Just Like Anne!)

(Dyer, Bristol) A cunning woman is consulted during this - “how far the cunning woman may have contributed to this, I will not pretend to say”
“Two hundred years ago the majority of the population… would have known at least one cunning-man or cunning-woman.”
“Individuals who straddled the worlds of both learned and low magic”
Davies' conclusion was that &quot;the campaign against cunning craft was ineffective.. to succeed, it needed the support of local communities, which was never given&quot;
&quot;many thousands of individuals&quot;
“Curing the mad, bad and sad” - sufferers of their autocosmics, or rather of the world!
“Few people in… the early modern… period considered cunning-folk to be in league with the devil.”
“Genuine respect moderated by doses of cynicism”

Quoting Keith Thomas - “The attempt by the theologicans to wipe out the distinction between black and white witches by branding them both as diabolical never got through to the people to whom these witches ministered”
“Particularly for those in rural areas magic and conjuration remained words associated with the world of cunning-folk, whose continued populatiry is apparent from renewed denunciations of their trade during the 19th century.&quot;
“I have not come accross any case where cunning-folk did not request or expect some form of payment either in kind or cash” - like authors!
Priests were often cunning-folk (or at least astrologers) - thought that they were helping their parishioners

Witchcraft Act not repealed until 1952 (from Hutton)

          Grimoires - (Sort Of) Like The Housekeeping!

Like cunning folk, courting autocosmics. 
Arbatel of magick has “unintelligble greek” near the start - drawing you in…
Carlos Gilly - ‘The First Book of White Magic and personal communication. The later parts of the Arbatel were announced several times, but never have been written. Don’t know who the author was. The Volschov catalogue listed many fictitious works.	
Make them objects of temptation.
&quot;miscellany&quot; containing &quot;magical recipes, mostly for healing&quot; -  Cadwaladr Davies' book
&quot;theological overkill&quot; in whom they are calling up.

“In the popular imagination it conjures up expectations of Devil worship, black magic and sacrifice; it creates ‘a sense of mystery that can only be dispelled by purchasing and reading the book.”
The spread of codices to the poor in chapbook form.
“Intrinsic Christian content of mafic.”
bibliomancy (dictionary of folklore) - &quot;well-attested&quot; 'dipping' in oxfordshire.
“A spell to make women dance naked”
“The grimoire continues to have huge culutral currency… not mere historical artefacts but cultural symbols. 

“The occult symbol… depicted… on the cover… was crucial to its commercial success.
The Devil as a character - a  person only experienced through mediation - witch trials, saying his name etc.

Setting up “supernatural protection rackets”
The Anglican Chrich “had long given up on trying to suppress popular magic at grassroots level”

Davies mentions a Burnley cunning-man who uses trigonometric and astrological terms for demons - “impressive names to ‘conjure’ with”

People would call down the Holy Ghost for small or ridiculous things - Judas for the results of a local election. Autocosmics at its height.

Whosoever disregards this does so at his own risk and peril. These are most dire.

Very autocosmic - conjuring dizzying images.

‘Abrahadabra’

Lots of wordplay.

Other Practices

Ritual marks were cut, scratched or carved into our ancestors’ homes and churches in the hope of making the world a safer, less hostile place.” (Duncan Wilson, guardian article)

Charms often on the house or outbuilding, windows or doors.
“Contents found inside the bottles suggests that some kind of recipe or formula of symbolic value was being adhered to.”

One of the most frequently referenced causes for belief in astrology is the so-called “Barnum Effect,” which is
named after the famous American showman P. T. Barnum. Commonly used in psychology, it refers to a
tendency for people to accept vague and general characterizations of themselves as accurate. Forer (1949) found
that vague statements such as “at times you are sociable, while at other times you are reserved” tended to impress
people as accurate personality descriptions. Glick, Gottesman, and Jolton (1989) demonstrated that although
believers in astrology were more likely to accept any type of personality description as accurate, regardless of
whether it was positive or negative, skeptics also were likely to fall prey to the Barnum effect, especially if the
personality descriptions they were given were positive. Moreover, even astrology skeptics were more likely to
call a description accurate if they were told it was based on their sign of the zodiac. Finally, skeptics who were
given a flattering horoscope demonstrated an increase in their favorable attitudes toward astrology.
Shermer (1997) discussed the same basic concept in the framework of evolutionary psychology. He posited that
it was beneficial to survival to make connections between things and events in the environment (red spiders are
poisonous), and that there was little to be lost by making too many connections or by making false positives
(blue spiders are also poisonous). In contrast, false negatives (red spiders are not poisonous) might be fatal, while
false positives are at worst unnecessary (avoiding all spiders). Therefore, Shermer believes humans might be
naturally inclined toward superstition, and consequently belief in astrology. After all, a belief in astrology is not
likely to have any negative impact on your day-to-day survival

“Strength of belief well beyond the period of the witch-trials”
“Others claimed to encounter them on a more regular basis, commonly developing a particularly close relationship with one or more spirits.”
“The affectionate and intimate relationship often found between the witch/cunning woman and her familiar/fairy”.

A form of ‘virtual being’ based on autocosmics surrounding superstitions, animals and characterisation.
Spontaneous folk belief, not based on elite writings: (Wilby) - not an ‘elite construction’. 
Animal forms, not particularly supernatural. Perhaps because of fear of the unnatural as being outside God, also because animals formed a symbiotic relationship with everyday people. (Wilby) “The familiar most frequently appeared in animal form, often living in domestic intimacy with the witch.”
Part of a continuum which included many different sorts of spirits - (Wilby) “Categories of spirit overlapped considerably.”
Familiar denoted “both the witch’s demonic spirit and… personal helping spirits”

Baudrillard is talking ‘a lot’ about the deenchanting of our surroundings. Autocosmics is important to enchantment. Indeed, this is what enchantment is!

Iconoclasts worried, says Baudrillard, that Iconoclasts worried because they thought the icons revealed that there was nothing behind them; they were just icons, ‘perfect simulacra’, rather than simulations, pretenses of something greater.
People were “content to venerate a filigree God” “already enacting his death and his disappearance in the eipophany of his representations” - this is a big subject, but I don’t think that God disappears because he is an icon, or into his icons. 
“But what if God can be sumulated… can be reduced to the signs that constitute faith? Then the whole system becomes weightless.”

Animism

[[We will talk about this more in Chapter 3]].

An arguable mismatch in our simulatory functions, based on bad interpretation of sense-data: the seeing of non-living things as living. (is it a mismatch, or can it be intentional).
Huizinga - “an innate tendency of ordinary life with personality”


Bobo Doll experiment (Bandura 1961?) - learn and adapt aggressive behaviours through watching others perform - important for autocosmics and games. (about ACTION).Learn behaviour through the provess of observation learning. We also watch the consequences of their actions - vicariou sreinforcement - we cna model it happening to ourselves. Can learn behaviour but NOT perform it because of the negative consequences we see (and simulate for ourselves).

[Difference between anthropomorphism and agency detection -&gt; latter is low-level, automatic, and anthropomorphism is more social response.]

There are many possible examples, spread across the breadth of human culture. All are particularly interesting, and have some relevance to my project. My reading has enhanced my project, and enhanced what I might consider inspirational.
Lots of debate about the role of human autocosmics in different cultural arenas.
Some very, very brief words (literally a list) on the breadth that I have researched in my pursuit of character. 
We will come back to some of these in later chapters, or cover them in more detail.

Robots (McCarthy Robot &amp; Baby, McCarthy Ascription of Mental States To Machines, Riek et al 2009, Sung, Gaver, Robin The Robot, Delft Study on Roomba Personality, Forlizzi &amp; DiSalvo, Wiseman, Braitenberg, Riskin, The Stem, Novikova and Watts, Novikova, Gaudl and Bryson, Ian Brown, Fink et al 2012, Novkiova 2014, Prendinger and Ishikuza 2005, Brazeal)
Toys (Tara Woodyer, Piaget, Turkle Second Self, Mishra, Weizenbaum)
Object Relations (Turkle Evocative Objects, Significant Objects guys)
Children (Walton, Winnicott 1953, Hood 2009, Marjorie Taylor, Gjersoe, Huizinga, Leonards, Donnelly, Bloom and Hood, Hickling &amp; Wellman, the Opies, Roser, Martinez et. al(2007))
The elderly (Zaitchik and Solomon 2008, PARO)


Even though principles of rationality seem as often violated as followed, we still cling to the notion that human thought should be rational, logical and orderly.” Internal logic is more important than external logic. Our perception is always partial. Merleau-ponty.

 I am deliberately avoiding going into great detail here, though I will focus on one particular strand of human autocosmics, and human characterisation, that arguably sits outside literature, and yet has massively influenced it through its autocosmic power. Also very relevant to the narrative I wish to tell.

Brookshaw, Sharon (2016) - children.
“Some 5-year-olds' portrayals of characters as mental agents were strikingly sophisticated in their use of contrastive representations, including false beliefs, to explain characters' actions and interactions.” - nicopoulos and richner

Bickmore &amp; Pickard
prosopopeia - Relies on autocosmics - delibertate characterisation of something, often an object, to stand for something else.
We imagine them as that person/thing, and the characteristics of that person/thing can extra-rationally change our opinions. 
Can offload negative POVs from the speaker.

Anthropomorphism “considered innate storytelling devices”

Micahel Fried - minimalism becomes theatrical through anthropomorphism

--------------------

Relational agents needing subtle expression (autocosmics) to build long-term relationships with users.



Anthropomorphism

A more specialist version of animism; imparting human characteristics on non-human living or non-living objects or entities.

Assigning human characteristics or form to non-human entities.
We do it from 3 months onward (who said this?)
Garrard - “unless trained not to do so, humans see human agency everywhere”
Anthropomorphism - “confusing thing and person” - assigning them mood and intent. Influences how we see and do everything. 
Steven Mithen - anthropomorphism represented a change in the human mind to simulation and empathy.
So is it empathy or anthropomorphism that we are doing with characters?




Even understanding something non-visual, it is argued in the stanford article, have sensory correlatives - we “hear” inner voices, “see” an imaginary place- to insist otherwise, that there is something intrinsic about the experience of understanding, thinking, remembering that is non-sensory or non-visual. Link to visual imagination in last section? - power of imagination.


“What becomes of the divintiy when it reveals itself in icons, when it is multiplied in simulacra… the visible machinery of icons substituted for the pure and intelligble Idea of God?”

animals maintain a compulsory discourse


Nowhere do they really speak, because they only furnish the responses one asks for. 

Animals have no unconscious, this is well known. Without a doubt, they dream, but this is a conjecture of a bioelectrical order, and they lack language, which alone gives meaning to the dream by inscribing it in the symbolic order. We can fantasize about them, project 134 our fantasies on them and think we are sharing this mise-en-scéne. But this is comfortable for us - in fact animals are not intelligible to us either under the regime of consciousness or under that of the unconscious.

Yocto has consciousness - he thinks in language - but this is not accessible to you.

Baudrillard says that the territory is not like the subconscious - it is known, and delimited.

Animals have no unconscious, because they have a territory. Men have only had an unconscious since they lost a territory.

At once territories and metamorphoses have been taken from them - the unconscious is the individual structure of mourning in which this loss is incessantly, hopelessly replayed - animals are the nostalgia for it.

Tsukogami - objects come to life.

&quot;how perceivers tend to substitute 'normal' antecedent events for exceptional ones in psychologically 'undoing' this specific outcome.&quot;
We use simulation to imagine the future from partial information - we fill in the gaps, we narratise.
Therefore, this can be influenced by making certain things easier to imagine than others.


Nan and not getting her tram is the same thing - Similar results were found with plane crash survivors. These individuals experienced a greater amount of anticipatory regret when they engaged in the highly mutable action of switching flights last minute. It was reasoned that this was due to a person “anticipating counterfactual thoughts that a negative event was evoked, because it tends to make the event more vivid, and so tends to make it more subjectively likely”.[3]
“counterfactual world - lottery experiment - how close is the thing you imagine to your situation now, and how will it affect your actions now.
This heuristic has shown to be a salient feature of clinical anxiety and its disorders, which are marked by heighted expectations of future negative events. A study done by David Raune and Andrew Macleod tried to tie the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this type of judgment to the simulation heuristic.[4]
Always trying to communicate our inner states, our inner hallucinations, by stimulating it in others.
Maybe all this in superstition?

Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky - the simulation heuristic - we think that outcomes easier to picture mentally are more likely.

Touch is an important superstitious interface, which the technology supports.
The question that they raise for us would thus be this one: don't we live now and already, beyond the effects of the linearity and the accumulation of reason, beyond the effects of the conscious and unconscious, according to this brute, symbolic mode, of indefinite cycling and reversion over a finite space? And beyond the ideal schema that is that of our culture, of all culture maybe, of the accumulation of energy, and of the final liberation, don't we dream of implosion rather than of explosion, of metamorphosis rather than energy, of obligation and ritual defiance rather than of liberty, of the territorial cycle rather than of
“The individual was usually alone, either in the countryside or at home, or in some sort of trouble”


[Collingwood] says there is a term for the techniques of deliberate evocation of specific emotions, though it is usually
applied to cultures other than our own. This term is 'magic'. In our society too such techniques abound: producing warm feelings towards other members of our community or hostile feelings towards members of other communities, inducing preference for a politician, prompting an inclination to buy a particular product. Such ordinary magic is not pseudo-science, but pseudo-art. Thriller writing is a form of such ordinary magic, it involves using words and actions in a preconceived plan to have a calculated emotional effect. (oatley)

Most important, however, is the question of the extent to which aesthetic illusion itself and an aesthetic approach to artworks that implies aesthetic distance are practiced or known in a given culture or period or whether, for instance, a worldview that favors magic enchantment prevails, owing to which specific artifacts are regarded as numinous realities.

 or a “magical reality”.

- Agatai - go to as many chruchees as you have letters in your name.
Iathecon - say strange words to everyone you meet.
Mathmaticians - James Reed working on Voynich and Soyga.
Internal logic is what they need, not necessarily logic to the outside world - like games!


 &quot;Soyga&quot; - &quot;stand up straight on your feet for one night&quot; - doing things outside the ritual to make it more conducive. Unus - fast for one day. - Saday - wash yourself in cold or warm water for three days with three days interpresed.
Soyga is a catholic book.



“Strange words” or “strange symbols” feature a lot in testimonies - hints of books, fleeting glimpses, like rare animals. Lack of understanding sends autocosms wild. 

Obviously a lot of grimoire’s power came in general ignorance about physical laws, mental illness etc. Etc. And now this is not anywhere near as effective. But the trope still exists, with all of its associations. 

“These published Indexes were probably counter-productive in that they served to inform and excite public interst in the very books of magic they were meant to suppress. 

From a historical point of view, the persuasiveness of aesthetic illusion may even be regarded as related to the process of secularization in the Western world, for the relevance of illusion as an effect of texts and artworks created according to the principle of &quot;matching&quot; them &quot;convincing[ly]&quot; with life-like appearances appears to have increased proportionally as belief in the self-evident meaningfulness of the world has decreased alongside the &quot;making&quot; of schematic artifacts according to the principle of efficient readability (cf. Gombrich 1960: 131, 99). It seems that with the increase of credibility invested in individual works, &quot;aesthetic&quot; belief has progressively filled the place occupied by philosophical and religious beliefs as tacit basis of meaning, even though, outside deconstructionist and postmodernist circles, belief in the power of representation as such persists.

Magic is, in fact, everything that
absolutely fascinates minds and attract souls by means
of words and deeds. This fascination and attraction are
demonstrated  by  exclamation,  following,  listening  and
approval. They are difficult for the mind to perceive, and their
causes are veiled from the simpleton. That is because it is a
divine force associated with advanced reasons for the purpose
of understanding it. What I am working on is a vague
discipline.

Clergy were the biggest users and makers of magical books. 

 You may know that he who chooses to do
this, will have delved in magic. This is necessary. The best part
of the scientific magic is speech. The Prophet is quoted as

in his book Al-Fusul 5 , &quot;As a friend may turn into an enemy by

words.&quot; Is not that a sort of magic?

I’m not trying to add to that scholarship.

Should not be laughed at or criticized - leave forever or turn into boggarts. 


Sìthean (fairies) also continued to play an important role in the lives of
country folk, as they had always done. As late as 1770, dairymaids on Skye
used to pour out some milk every day as an offering to the gruagach (brownie);
in Suddie parish, not far from Inverness, children who suffered from a wasting
illness were said to be having their substance removed by the sìthean and
were taken to a particular well in the hope of a cure; Adam Donald, the
so-called ‘Prophet of Bethelnie’ (1703–80), was said to have been a changeling
left by the fairies, a status which clearly enhanced the magical and divinatory
powers with which he was credited, and because of which he was consulted
by large numbers of people from as far away as thirty miles beyond his
dwelling-place.

(p.86)

The superstitious use of wells in scotland - refer to Anne’s place.
Second sight (again in scotland, p.87) - the way it is described sounds much like the autocosmic.
This aural aspect to the second sight is confirmed by modern experience
which explains that, as well as seeing an image, one may hear, too. 26

Likewise, Isobel Crawford
was summoned before the kirk session of Old Aberdeen on 15 January 1727,
as being a woman guiltie of charmes and a teller of fortunes, such as telling
what a man any woman will be married with, and what a woman a man will
be married with: as also that she could give ane account that if any person
had any thing stolen from them, she could tell them if it could be got back
againe; and that if any persons who went abroad, she would give ane account
if they were dead or alive, and the lyke. 28

A series of rules.

In short, she was
convinced that her words had genuine power to harm and that her magic was
real enough. Equally convinced, it seems, was her neighbour; and this is an
incident that dates to about the beginning of the nineteenth century


Most witches, as far as the Kirk could see (and the
records bear this out), were ignorant charmers, not enemies of the Church
in league with Satan. 4was John Brown of Haddington who, in 1745,
was accused of being in league with witches, apparently because he was very
learned and possessed a Greek New Testament
Perhaps the most interesting part of this anecdote is the admission that the
minister himself accepted he had been bewitched.

 In Elgin, in 1734, Duncan Gregor was referred to the presbytery for
curing fevers, and in Strathblane in Stirlingshire, Katharine Cameron and
William Muldoe were brought before the kirk session for curing a horse by
passing a cat three times round and over it. 39

Magic and witchcraft therefore constituted the scenery, and often the
script, of everyone’s life during the eighteenth century as much as it had ever
done in the seventeenth or sixteenth. 

In fact from a judicial perspective at least, the state, rather like the Kirk,
Witchcraft and magic in Scotland 93
had been progressively losing interest in witches from the beginning of the
century. 

It would seem that there was neither an outright rejection of the
concept of witchcraft nor a great willingness to prosecute.


Meanwhile the rest of society continued to talk within itself much
as it always had done and gradually became accustomed, not simply to not
talking to the advocates and ministers about witches and magic, but to not
talking to them at all about anything.

Charms - worn on clothing, in the walls of houses. 

Such finds reported to the author include: dolls (one
cut in half), rats, toads, belt buckles, pipes, coins, knives and garments. Other
finds worthy of note include a complete pig skeleton under a floor in Norfolk,
a human skull and crossbones from beneath a nineteenth-century public
house, an entire donkey buried under a barn, a dried puppy and several dried
hares. Many artefacts from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages have also been
found concealed in buildings. Stone axes and flint arrowheads were thought
to be particularly effective against lightning and were known as thunder-
stones. They were believed to have been created where lightning struck the
ground. 67 All of these appear to have been considered as part of the spiritual
armoury of the house.

Particularly in the period in which Anne Latch lived. - I’m using an english context.
Roberta Harding on superstition: “Even in today’s technologically advanced and scientifically sophisticated society, they continue to be part of the cultural landscape.”
For Harding, they are “a manifestation of humankind’s longstanding effort to comprehend the elementary principles of good and evil.”
To “understand… explain… determine… it promotes the materialization of a specific outcome… the belief’s veracity is irrelevant.”
Even “unnecessary to consciously believe in the superstition.”
Charms, amulets and talismans - Objects are imbued with great meaning (reference to many, including Turkle’s “evocative objects”)
The creature is halfway between a charm and a talisman; not worn on the body, placed somewhere else, and must be interacted with, and believed in, to achieve result. Depending on one’s view, it is either made of natural materials or manufactured.
“At a mass execution and burning in 1786, twelve spectators went up to the gallows, where the executioner ‘rubbed the still warm hands of the six dangling bodies upon their necks and faces as a supposed cure for wens.”
Harding has an interesting tone here - speaking as if these superstitions really worked, at least rhetorically; a recognisance of the power of autocosmics? (”These superstitions prevented and cured a variety of ailments.”)
Harding - healthcare was so poor, expensive or painful that autocosmics offered an easier, imaginary way out, reinforced by psychosomatics and cultural surroundings.
“Superstitions function as a form of public healthcare”
A combination of claims by cunning folk and the ready belief of a suffering public.
Only started to change as executions became private and less frequent; the access to municipal ‘evocative objects’ in most people’s everyday life declined. Belief adapted around this famine, and moved onto something else.
De Blecourt, quoting Briggs - “there could plainly be a random element in the operation.”
“How and why people chose to consult particular specialists, when confronted with illness, death or loss”
(In Davies) John Dove “foolish artifices… against mischief merely imaginary”
Numerous examples (in Davies, Wilby etc.) of people feeling better very often after trips to cunning-folk, there did seem to be a balance between belief, evidence and ‘spoiling the sport’. (In Davies, “she swore she had lost several inches”). But, “cunning-folk were not always respected, or their powers believed in”.
Indeed, prosecutions were necessary because people believed.
Davies - “magical activities were no longer considered as technically feasible but rather explicitly fraudulent pretences designed to fool the credulous”. (After Witchcraft Act of 1736)
Reginald Scot (1584) Discoverie of Witchcraft - denounced witchcraft as autocosmics, but his book was used as an autocosmic manual! Followed in scepticism by Thomas Ady, Robert Filmer, John Wagstaff, John Webster and others.
Isaac Bickerstaff (really Jonathan Swift) writes a mock almanac, and it is taken as real!
“Presumably, however, there had always been a signifgicant number of people, not only amongst farmers, artisans and tradesmen but also the labouring classes, who were outright sceptitcal about the magical abilities of cunning-folk, and scorned their peers for consulting them.
People did not stop believing in magic - they just moved on to needing other autocosmics, no longer requiring the services of the cunning folk.
We still look to astrology today
Cunning-folk “generally believed in their own powers” (smith)
Davies - people were susceptible to auto-suggestion and magical thinking to differing degrees, even in indigenous settings.
“Merely providing a concrete diagnosis of witchcraft could have a beneficial, psychosomatic effect.”
Used instead of medical doctors who could not provide a reason - autocosmics, and autosuggestion, provide a reason from the cunning-person.
“The power of positive thinking has been proven to have physiological beenfits, and so, in this sense at least, magic may have worked.”
“Sympathetic associatioN” - magical thinking
“Adorning consulting rooms with unusual objects and decorations”
Educated people went to lower-class cunning-folk - a “reversal” of the idea of enlightening rationalism filtering down the social classes.
Bouba/kiki effect for characters in grimoires.
John Parkin’s charms - “power would be effective only as long as [the client] fervently believed in them.
“Althoguht the word ‘abracadabra’ is now used lightheartedly, and is associated with stage magic, it was once considered one of the most powerful of words and not to be used in jest”.
Charms “not meant to be read”. Just autocosmic power.
“The ability to write and copy out charms was in itself an exhibition of power, in addition to the magical strength of what was written.




“The Grand Pentacle or Circle of Solomon will answer for the above and
following Conjurations, which can be said on all days and at all hours. If it
be desired to speak only with one spirit, one only need be named, at the

Quite Catholic., unsurprising - theatrics are important, the weight of Christian mythology.
For Friday, to Bechard.
This experience is peformed an night from eleven to twelve o’clock, and a

Bechard! Come, Bechard!

To summon Silcharde - This experience is made at night, from three to four o’clock, at which
hour he is called, and appears in the form of a King. A little bread must be
given him when he is required to depart; he renders man happy and also
discovers treasures. Write about the circle as follows:
Holy God! Holy God! Holy God!

I conjure and command you, 0 Spirits, all and so many as ye are, to accept
this Book with good grace, so that whensoever we may read it, the same
being approved and recognised as in proper form and valid, you shall be
constrained to appear in comely human form when you are called,
accordingly as the reader shall judge. In no circumstances shall you make
any attempt upon the body, soul, or spirit of the reader, nor inflict any harm
on those who may accompany him, either by mutterings, tempests, noise,
scandals, nor yet by lesion or by hindrance in the execution of the
commands of this Book. I conjure you to appear immediately when the
conjuration is made, to execute without dallying all that is written and
enumerated in its proper place in the said book. You shall obey, serve,
instruct, impart, and perform all in your power for the benefit of those who
command you, and the whole without illusion. If perchance some of the
invoked spirits be unable to come or appear when required, they shall be
bound over to send others vested with their power, who also shall swear
solemnly to execute all that the reader may demand, and ye are all hereby
enjoined by the Most Holy Names of the Omnipotent Living God,
ELOYM, JAH, EL, ELOY, TETRAGRAMMATON, to fulfil everything as
it is set forth above. If ye obey me not, I will force you to abide in torments
for a thousand years, as also if any one of you receive not this Book with
entire resignation to the will of the reader.


I conjure thee, Evil and Accursed Serpent, N.. to appear at my will and
pleasure, in this place, before this circle, without tarrying, without
companions, without grievance, without noise, deformity, or murmuring. I
exorcise thee by the ineffable names of God, to wit, Gog and Magog, which
I am unworthy to pronounce; Come hither, Conic hither, Come hither.
Accomplish my will and desire, without wile or falsehood. Otherwise St.
Michael, the invisible Archangel, shall presently blast thee in the utmost
depths of hell. Come, then, N., to do my will.

Grand Grimoire has you astain from opposite sex - eat at certain times.
“Sleep as little as possible” - this will certainly make you autocosmic!
Cut a branch with a fork that is exactly nineteen and a half inches long, at sunrise exactly - exactitiude is so important.
Grand Grimoire even tells you what Lucifer will say. Lays out exactly how things will go. It is a story, which you are expected to believe will happen. In a way, it doesn’t matter if people actually perform the ritual or not…
Very hyperbolic language - provoke imagination./
“Articles” of the covenant between them.
It describes what will happen when you go to get treasure (see a big dog) - autocosmics.
Leave not bad odors - can almost smell them, though!
The signs and characters of the spirits - a bit of bouba/kiki going on here!
The characters of demons, their dialogue.
Provoking auto-suggestion.
Add in enough doubt and circumstance that you will blame yourself if something goes wrong.
For my creature, however, the rituals DO work, and DO matter!
“To enchant firearms”, “to win any time one plays the lottery” - long latin incantation for this one.
“To compel one dance completely naked”
“To prevent a woman from conceiving”
“To make everything in an apartment appear Black”
“Glue to repair porcelain vases”
The “apple of love” and other things.
Auto-magic tricks
“Natural mummy”, “vervain leaves”

Haunted Machines - an ongoing investigation into narratives of myth, mafic and haunting around technology. The continued proliferation of connected devices and the narratives driving them forward has been running parallel to stories of surveillance, hacking and black boxes. While designers and technologists talk about 'magic' and 'enchantment' in regard to these devices, we forget that magic is a form of deception; a sleight of hand. Thinkers, writers, designers and artists are beginning to refer more and more to a new time of hauntings and the supernatural in respect of this new technological climate.

&quot;contributing to this pleasure is the variety, the uncertainty, the not-seeing-evertything, and therefore being able to walk abroad using the imagination in regard to what one does not see&quot;


&quot;we might even say that in a narrative any object is always magic&quot; - objects as characters, as embued with a special force.&quot;

Norman - “manuals tend to be less helpful than they should be”.
“In the best of worlds, the manuals would be written first, then the design could follow the manual.”

Norman’s call to standardise is similar to the idea of ritual, of organised religion, of shared practice - it makes discrepancy difficult, and reinforces the unity of the character that you are worshipping. Gods like units of measurements, glyphs and signs, keyboards. A set of “cultural constraints”.

70s - even talking about magic, even if condemning it, could get you imprisoned and your books burned - they still provoked the imagination. Must be ignored and forgotten.

They had autocosmic power beyond their words (p.67) in Venice 1500s, scraps and words and phrases taken out of context from the Key of Solomon and became prpotectuve talismans. 
As to the Arbatel, my hunch is that the other 8 books never existed and it was just the usual grimoire fabrication.
 Might be worth confirming with Bernd-Christian Otto in terms of the Swiss/German editions.
Owen Davies - confirmed my suspicions!
Dr. Otto - often was “techniques to impress and heighten attractivity”, but he is not sure-  may have existed in manuscript form. Even so, why not print? The rituals would not work…

What they believed is not entirely discountable.
I am therefore completing the character pairing that is promised by the grimoire- the apparition of the spirit. But, the spirit is autocosmic, as it always must be - we can never create in actuality the things from our imagination.
Tolkein - “the world was alive with mythical beings”
Medical has always had a lot of superstitions - the body as  unknown system - body as enviornment - character as environment
Davies - “natural magic was considered by many intellectuals to be a branch of the sciences, as it dealt with the occult powers within nature.”
References neo-platonism (char as enviro)
Low magic “a rich medley of indigenous beliefs, practices and rituals”
“There were no manuals to instruct the initiate on associated beliefs and practices.
“The incorporation of christian beliefs and prayers.
“People recognised that… ‘arcane arts’ were to a large extent acquired skills derived from books.”

The Rood of Grace as “theatrical miracle” (Groeneveld)
Reformationgot rid of many images - Protestantism is either devoid of autocosmics, or could be argued is rife with it (you do not need much to create a narrative).
Rood is a medieval pre-Reformation evocation of ‘true’ folk religion
The nature of movement, and the concealment of illusion, are part and parcel of theatre and puppetry.
Groeneveld does not see the difference between the Rood as theatre and as magic as a difference at all. It “straddled categories”, which made Protestant reformers uncomfortable, so they denigrated it as a mere puppet. No such thing as a mere puppet, though!
My creature is actually very, very similar to the Rood of Grace and other automaton christs, but I heard of them afterwards.
This history of Roods and moving images in the Church is tied quite intimately to the history of the Reformation in England, the sweeping away of Catholic mysticism and theatrical iconoclasm - while this is not very important to my enquiry, it is important to note, as it tinges a lot of the descriptions of these now-lost objects with subjectivity. The consensus of the crowd was not naivety, but instead a cultural acceptance of theatrical idols. We have similar things now with ubicomp?
Protestant reformers were keen to play up the stupidity and credulity of the simplistic Catholic flock.
They were often imagined with lives of their own, naughty, capricious, even rapacious and loving - not as solemn and unimaginative as everybody likes to think. The autocosmic at work even here!
Accounts of the roods abilities were augmented over time - all people who had not seen it, became more in the public imagination. Not seeing is better than seeing. It actually only did a few things.
Puppets only came in later, in the 16th and 17th centuries
Puppet shows called ‘Italian motions’
Theatrical ‘context-setting’ process for getting access to the Rood by the monks - getting the common folk in the mood.
This hatred of iconoclasm seemed to be confined to reformers and literary heroes - the common folk loved the theatre of it all.
Groeneveld here stresses the idea of Catholic mysticism as relying on the lack of understanding and misrepresentation by the populace, who must be educated in the mechanical heresies of the idols that they worship in the churches.
“Expose through translation into the vernacular” - make the strange image mundane through explanation through scripture.
A social sport-spoiling.
Groeneveld shows that miracle can be non-serious and theatre serious. There is not a separation, necessarily, between the two.
She points out that many were able to be entertained by holy images, as well as worship them.
The story published by the monks about the Rood are part of its context. As Brownbill says, “the real reason why the image was supposed to be miraculous, was the extraordinary way in which the monastery had acquired it.”
Context produces the effect of the rood, not the rood itself.
She calls the blessing and reactions to the Rood “personal affective responses”
The representation of a thing is a “rememoration” of it - the closer to the truth it is, the more powerful (I.e. the rood is closer to christ than the eucharistic wafer, which has always been an autocosmic symbol) - but how far can you go along this path to “simulation”?
“The mechanical object was not necessarily an object designed to trick or confuse”
This spring clean of dusty Catholic mysticism coincided with the translation of the Bible into English and a need for simple, uniform interpretation.Dogma is the contradictory heart of human religion. Religion is born and thrives on autocosmics; dogma seeks to control the human imagination and conscious thought. It never works, not completely.

Groeneveld states that removing and parading the Rood before destruction was designed to decontextualise it, to bring it into the “harsh light of day” rather than the theatrical settings of the monastery. The spoilsporting is really interesting here.


Witch trials, racism,

Catholocism possessed a fundamental vehicle - ability to use bisual communication.
&quot;the believer is called upon personally to paint frescoes crowded with figures on the walls of his mind, starting out from the stimuli that his visual imagination succeeds in extracting from the theological proposition of a laconic verse from the gospels&quot;

Grimoire - &quot;the world's secrets were cotained in the combinatoria of the signs used in writing.&quot; - the alphabet as a magical system, in combination, in autocosmics.&quot;
&quot;words as a perpetual pursuit of things, as a perpetual adjustment to their infinite variety&quot;
Magical thinking made much worse by stress - a method of control amongst people who cannot handle ambiguity - must find explanations (Keinan, 1994).

'simpatias' in Brazil - &quot;intutive causal principles&quot; - time of day, repetition of procedures - just like with the creature! Relate this forward to manuals/grimoires. It *seems&quot; like they should work. And &quot;transcendental influence&quot; (presence of religious iconography - make rituals more effective. The character of ritual, the setting, the context, the techniques used to stimulate the autocosmic (just like character).

Why Rituals Work (Scientific American)
--------------------------------------

(Gino &amp; Norton)

People facing situations that induce anxiety typically take comfort in engaging in preparatory activities, inducing a feeling of being back in control and reducing uncertainty.

 the symbolic behaviors we perform before, during, and after meaningful event – are surprisingly ubiquitous, across culture and time. Rituals take an extraordinary array of shapes and forms. At times performed in communal or religious settings, at times performed in solitude; at times involving fixed, repeated sequences of actions, at other times not. People engage in rituals with the intention of achieving a wide set of desired outcomes, from reducing their anxiety to boosting their confidence, alleviating their grief to performing well in a competition – or even making it rain.

Research shows that rituals do have an effect on our mind - they reduce anxiety/stress/grief whatever. Actions within a magic circle/suspension of disbelief having an effect - just like fiction!

Sportsperson rituals.

Malinowski's observations of rtials amongst south pacific islanders.

rituals when they face situations where the outcome is important and uncertain and beyond their control

 Our results suggest that engaging in rituals mitigates grief caused by both life-changing losses (such as the death of a loved one) and more mundane ones (losing a lottery).

Some initial research into the nature of the ritual tied to its efficacy (i.e. how much you believe it, and consequently how much it effects you). How many steps, at a certain time. The more specific, the more meaningful it appears to be.

Despite the absence of a direct causal connection between the ritual and the desired outcome, performing rituals with the intention of producing a certain result appears to be sufficient for that result to come true.

Chimps having rituals - repeated, mysterious actions -&gt; sacred sites.

Ian Reader says that though people do not any longer believe in them, they still turn to them. 

(murray) Religious services are designed as narrative bottlenecks, to control people’s exposure to the machinery of the divine - not fraudulent, merely reliant on both sides performing in a certain way, after being given the furniture of the suspension of disbelief.

The toems - the grandmother on guernsey

Book of Daniel - Now the Babylons had an idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine. And the king worshipped it and went daily to adore it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said unto him, Why dost not thou worship Bel? Who answered and said, Because I may not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh. Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is a living God? seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?....

Radiocarbon dating the shroud of turin paper - it’s a medieval hoax.
Seeing letters on the shroud - reading masses into them. Flowers, etc.
Such a huge amount of time spent on the shroud - cannot just reject something so autocosmic out of hand.
Fetish - an object that has power over others
Pietz - fetishism was a response from white christians to demonise black African worship practices, part of a western skewed timeline of religion from ‘primitive’ to ‘civilised’.
Related to abrahamic idolatry biases.
Fetishistic - the word can almost be a character now - slimy etc.
Fetishism is relating to objects instead of people.
MacGaffey ‘94 - “&quot;Fetishism&quot; is about relations among people, rather than the objects that mediate and disguise those relations.”
From the Portuguese fetishism made thing - it already has a moralistic intent.
Icons as well.
dead likeness of the dead - Acts of John (NO! Not dead at all!)

Idolatry - generally seen as bad.
“False idols” is a tautology?

Re. Astrology beliefs - can have scientific literacy and autocosmics - this is because autocosmics is important to everybody, and difficult to pick and choose. We still use anthropomorphised markers in our science (I.e. the Zodiac).
Autocosmics is about pattern - astronomy based in astrology, chemistry in alchemy. Science’s strength, I think, will be in courting th human autocosmic with facts. 
“No known case of a cunning person or charmer calling upon a pagan deity”
Familiars “usually believed to be visible in animal form”
“Cross between frog and rat allegedly owned by a Cambridgeshire woman, or the ‘creepy-crawly things’ which one in Essex was said to feed in a circle with chopped gress” - also in chapter 3?

&quot;in a still semi-literate society, the written word was credited as intrinsically potent&quot;

Even today, astronomers still refer to the zodiacal constellations when
mapping the sky

We conclude that the prevalence of belief in astrology
among college undergraduates does not imply poor scientific literacy, as measured by an instrument similar to
that used to guide public science education policy. Pseudoscience beliefs are widespread, and are somewhat
mitigated by college science classes, but they can coexist with legitimate scientific knowledge.

These results, taken from our larger instrument to diagnose science knowledge and
attitudes, indicate that astrology is part of a larger landscape of susceptibility to pseudoscience thinking among
college undergraduates.

Hutton questions whether cunning-craft ever died out - merely metamorphosed into &quot;alternative&quot; therapies of today.


In Honorius - books were shortcuts to getting spirits to appear so you did not have to do the rituals over and over.

Aiwass -separate from crowley - imagination taking on great proportions. Unconscious manifestation of crowley’s personality - “colossal wish fulfulment” 
Ah, you realize that magick is something we do to ourselves. But it is more convenient to assume the objective existence of an angel who gives us new knowledge than to allege that our invocation has awakened a supernormal power in ourselves. (Kaczynski, 542)[11



&quot;R.R Marrett agreed that ritual was essential and belief secondary... emotion rather than reason was the key&quot; (398)
Israel Ragrdie - &quot;If Aiwass was his own Higher Self, then the inference is none other than that Aleister Crowley was the author of the Book, and that he was the external mask for a variety of different hierarchical personalities ... The man Crowley was the lowest rung of the hierarchical ladder, the outer shell of a God, even as we all are, the persona of a Star

“Cult” means 
Murti in Hinduism or Jainism - any object that is deified. The idol becomes identical with the deity. Either made or natural. Treated as guests. (With definite shape or limits) - an object. Idol - painting any non-anthropomorphic obkect. 
Might be abstract forms (aniconic).
Focus on sporituality, meditate in front of them. 


It is much more difficult to focus on God as the unmanifested than God with form, due to human beings having the need to perceive via the senses.[44]

Bhagavad gita
It is not the real thing, but is a manifestation and reminds the viewer of the original thing of valuee - “treating the murti as the manifestation of a revered guest.”


Everything is worthy of worshup as everything has divine energy within it. 

The idol is an “object-to-think-with”
Trees worshipped as well (parijaat tree in uttar pradesh)

Japanese and Indians propping up trees. Not really to protect them, however.
 
Sir James Frazer's 'classic'# (Hutton) definition of magic - practices desgined to bring spiritual or supernatural forces under the control of human agents. 
I am concerned with 'low magic'
Cult Image - worshipped FOR the deity. But Yocto IS the deity.
An idol is worshipped AS deity.
Of course, abrahamic religions don’t like this - is this why autocosms are deprecated?
The Apis Bull - the idol in the book of genesis.

“Hollow forms” - good title! Like a drum, then? Not a bad thing!

Animals

The way we talk about pets Ben Fogle - “ a little black dog who infiltrated my whole life, who showed undiluted loyalty”
Dawn Murray - ‘Rats are intelligent. If they come home and call their rat’s name it will come out and see them. When the rat dies, they return to a very empty home.”
Difference between wild and tame - we’ll talk about that later.
Roy Hattersley (in Adam Lusher) - “Buster’s death was the most painful thing I had ever experienced, more painful than losing my mother.”
“One’s affections aren’t objective.” (hattersley again”
Bruce Fogle - animals “evoke in us the same response as a human infant) - look this.
“The ways dogs and cats have big eyes in the middle of the face.”
Judith Kerr - (in Lusher) - “they are not human, but they do communicate… it’s mostly about food, or getting a door opened, but one is in touch with them”
I wonder if it is the quotidian nature, the ‘getting-to-know’ them.
Lusher points out that most people get another pet.
Ben Fogle (in Lusher) -  “Its personality will grow, another equally intimate bond will develop, and that’s the thing. “I never want to experience another day like when I lost Inca, but I know I will. We go ahead, knowing that we will outlive our pets, that all this will happen again. Because grief is the price we pay for love.”
&quot;The churches have been slow to recognise the spiritual significance of the human-animal bond,&quot; says Rev Prof Andrew Linzey, an Anglican priest and director of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.
&quot;When a companion animal dies, we feel a natural sense of dislocation and loss. The churches should offer us rites to help us deal with our bereavement.&quot;

Veteran trees are characters as well. Size is important, as is age. Trees don’t usually stand out (sometimes on their own, without a wood, their context is important).
Hal Herzog - oxytocin released in brain from eye contact. But doesn’t happen with wolves, raccoons, squirrels. Cute, maybe, but not bonding.
“Training a hawk was like psychoanalysis.”
Carl Safina - “fables posed animals as caricatures of human impulses.”
“Metaphorical projections that had built up on many animals like old coats of paint.”
We still anthropomorphise, even in the face of science today.
“Voicing informed, logical inferences about other animals’ motiviation, emotion and awareness could wreck your career prospects”
We can only talk about observable behaviour. 
Safina sees the insistence on ignoring the concept of animal emotion as making the human unique, dividing us from the animal kingdom - to me, it instead looks like a recognizance of the incredible power of autocosmics; however, it still refuses to accept that autocosmics (which helps society run by letting us understand others) could ever help us to understand animals.
“What is she thinking? What is she seeing”
Emotional Support Animal - does not need training 
For mental health problems
Alice Villalobos - “we can be too emotionally involved and subjective” to know when to have our animals put down. 


H is for Hawk - “so much of what she means is made of people”

&quot;even a simple housecat is a complex, dynamic system&quot;

COMFORT ANIMALS
What animals are was another theme that emerged from my reading: Fudge (2002) suggests that
we humans have a fascination for animals that is, in part, born of their similarity and difference to
us. Like us, they are born, they live, they breathe and they die, and they communicate, yet they
don’t speak. In all three papers we hear how the coexistence of this living similarity and living dif-
ference brings an element to the therapeutic encounter that is somehow at the heart of the work
undertaken.

Joanna Bryson - embodiement and mimetics “many of the behaviours attributed to intelligence are in fact a simple physical consequence of an animals skeletal and muscular constraints.

o watch a poor sow,

Lying in her own waste, unable to enjoy

heartbreaking. The experience places you in

alternatives ??? is a broadly unpopular solution ignored by plants and single-cell
organisms, though both of these are capable of expressing behaviors in response to
their environment. Bacteria move toward or away from substances and behave
socially with other bacteria to improve their situation and prospects for preserving
their genes, sometimes at the cost of self-sacri¯cex [Rankin et al., 2010]. Plants are
capable of responding not only to light and nutrients but also to pheromones of other
(e.g., host) species of plants, and to direct their growth accordingly [Trewavas, 2005].
Virtual Pet Companions by GeriJoy
“Gerijoy Companion, a virtual pet for seniors” touch them through a tablet device, talk to them
Emotional isolation is a factor in older people’s mortaility. “Studies show that having a pet is good for seniors as it makes seniors feel better physically, mentally and emotionally. “ (though very little clinical evidence for medical benefit of animals, but clearly people like them and feel happier, if not more well.

At the University of Rochester Behavioral Health Center, researchers followed 830 primary care patients age 60 and older. They found pet owners were 36% less likely to report loneliness, compared to seniors without pets.


Watching teddy really does make you think that he’s computable.

Animals - H. Krieg - “motor extravagances” - feelings of pleasure.

AAT - animals demonstrably improve somebody’s social functioning - is this the opposite, torture an animal?
Not a huge amount of evidence

The time spent with the animation is an issue - really you need a relationship to build up. Mobile is good for this, but ubicomp and the app architecture reduces the individual importance of the creature. Maybe you need a household shrine sort of thing?

“Noticing breathing” is important
Lots of AAT relies on the tactility of animals - we do not have this - how can we replicate it?
The creature cannot be a replacement for more tactile AAT, nor would I ever suggest it.
This is the issue with all characters - we need to get to know them quickly.



The Lowenmensch in Germany - earliest zoomorphic figure - imagining others, giving the autocosmic a shape.

Cows in religion - animals have souls, all have souls, interchangeable forms - rely on them heavily. Autocosmic in the extreme.
Our love for animals is a convenient aberration - they affect us evolutionarily (Garrard)Personality in animals - consistent invdividual traits that differ from other animals of the same species.
This is the scientific definition; however, many people (Helen Macdonald is a good example) find personality in animals in how they cleave to, or represent, the general characteristics of a species. Is this personality, however, individualising, or rather essentialising through allomorphism.

Cats do have personalities, but are they only to do with breed or genetic assoications such as eye color etc? (Wilhelmy, Serpel et. Al 2016)
Call them “behaviour pathologies” - but are they not just ‘traits’?
But then that is breeding into a particular culture - would be interesting to see a similar study for moggies.
Not actually any evidence that independent of breed behaviour is affected by appearance. 
Colour affects personality traits (Delgado) but colour is remarkably related to breed. COmes from owner assoications (non-experts) through observation (and cultural bias?)
We found that red cats had increased prey interest independent
of breed, as evaluated by the Fe-BARQ. This finding may make sense
in the context that red cats represent a larger percentage of the
population in rural environments (Pontier et al., 1997) where feral
or semiferal cats still subsist on small prey (MacDonald et al., 2000).
Context and domain is important, then.
Mammals with reduced retinal pigment have been shown
to develop correspondingly increased cross retinal projections

Never would the humanities or psychoanalysis have existed if it had been miraculously possible to reduce man to his &quot;rational&quot; behaviors.

Baudrillard is super-duper against industrialisation, in the animal passage
Re. Cats “from the moment that I has a name, its name survives it. It signs its potential disappearance.”
Bestiality, and its principle of uncertainty, must be killed in animals.

The creature is unwilded by her processe, by her appliancing of it.
You are systematising it as you chunk it.
This example shows that we call behaviour
intelligence only when we see how that behaviour is
adaptive for the animal. This is precisely the idea that
“intelligence is in the eyes of the observer” (Brooks
1991). We should not, however, be fooled to believe
that intelligence is only in our eyes. If we change the
environment of the animal in such a way that its
initial behaviour is no longer adaptive, we can make
an interesting observation. If the animal persists in
its original behaviour, we no longer consider it
intelligent, but if it, on the other hand, changes its
behaviour to adapt it to the new circumstances, we
will still think of it as intelligent in some sense.
This, I think, makes intelligence equivalent to the
capacity of learning.

Lorenz’ and Tinbergen’s innate releasing mechanisms  - Balkenius 1994.
Perhaps what we believe to be intelligence
is only an amalgamation of such fixed behaviours.
“the tick will bite everything that has a

Our destiny has never been separated from theirs, and this is a sort of bitter revenge on Human Reason, which has become used to upholding the absolute privilege of the Human over the Bestial.

esides, animals were only demoted to the status of inhumanity as reason and humanism progressed. A logic parallel to that of racism. An objective animal &quot;reign&quot; has only existed since Man has existed.

It would take too long to redo the genealogy of their respective statuses, but the abyss that separates them today, the one that permits us to send beasts, in our place, to respond to the terrifying universes of space and laboratories, the one that permits the liquidation of species even as they are archived as specimens in the African reserves or in the hell of zoos - since there is no more room for them in our culture than there is for the dead - the whole covered by a racist sentimentality (baby seals, Brigitte Bardot), this abyss that separates them follows domestication, just as true racism follows slavery.

With agriculture, we stopped looking at animals and started to look at ourselves.


Therapy animals - non-aggressive, predictable behaviour (like a god), curious, appealing, entertaining, non-judgemental. They are “better than medicine” Therapy animals for each other, unconditional love. 
“Nothing will have ever given me more food for thinking… than these moments when I see myself naked under the gaze of a cat.”
Bachi - Already, in this brief personal reflection, a mixed picture of human relationships with animals
is emerging; enjoyed as pets, protected in the garden, looked and wondered at in captivity, studied
and conserved in the wild.
Nevertheless, in my consulting room I have a
much-handled bag of puppets including a fox, a bear, a rabbit and a box of plastic creepy crawl-
ies, which include flies, spiders and beetles. The books on my shelves also include many chil-
dren’s titles with animals as key figures. I use animal imagery in guided relaxation, if children
ask, and always enquire about family pets. The younger children I meet as in-patients on the
medical wards will almost always have a cuddly toy with them, often a creature. Such compan-
ions are always acknowledged and, if appropriate invited to take part in a consultation.

Beasts of burden, they had to work for man. Beasts of demand, they are summoned to respond to the interrogation of science.*2 Beasts of consumption, they have become the meat of industry. Beasts of somatization, they are now made to speak the &quot;psy&quot; language, to answer for their psychic life and the misdeeds of their unconscious.

Animal behaviour book detail the physiological control of systems in animals. Well understood, biologically. Does not necessarily detract from

Animals somatize! Extraordinary discovery! Cancers, gastric ulcers, myocardial infarction in mice, pigs, chickens! 

Later - recourse to environment allows animals to be represented complexly in context, at a human level - not below us, but beside us.


Descartes - solipsism

Umwelt - species-specific, spatio-temporal, 'self-in-world'
“the perceptual world in which an organism exists and acts as a subject”

Bodily, very important - “flesh of the world” in merleau-ponty’s idea.

“Carriers of significance or marks” which are what interests the animals.
Unwelt is about what you can sense - but autocosmics is about what is inside. You need to meet this discrepancy.
He was influential on computer science.
Many of his ideas are poorly defined in modern terms.
Form their own sense of time - the outside world is intepreted.
Not just the senses but internal cognitive factors as well - the tick is interpreting and extrapolating the world? No, not necessarily. Well, still assuming! Only know sthe temperature, not the nature of what they see.
The organism has sensors that report the state of the Umwelt and effectors that can change parts of the Umwelt. He distinguished the effector as the logical opposite of the sensor, or sense organ. Sensors and effectors are linked in afeedback loop. Sensor input is processed by a Merkorgan and effectors are controlled by a Werkorgan. The modern term 'sensorimotor' used in enactive theories of cognition encompasses these concepts.

Therefore the human as an autocosmic system.
Computational art is a subset of cybernetics.
Innerwelt and umwelt - together, (inside world and surrounding world) a subjective viewpoint
Innerwelt is autocosmics, really, not umwelt.

All animals restricted by ceremonies. 
“It was the moral position of the spirit’s user, rather then that of the spirit itself, which determined the spirit’s moral status at any given time”
The prevalence of reinforcement learning in the 50s (Balkenius)
Read Sebeok as well on Umwelt - “self-centered world”. This is a related concept to the “self worlds” of autocosmics.
Made of components, each of which has meaning to the animal
‘Functional’ circle - reshaping umwelt as it interacts with the world (magic circle?)
Umwelts interacting creates a semiosphere - I.e. in the reading group!
Autocosmics does not mean that the world, sensory etc. Are not important - but they are intricately tied up with the mind. 
Different worlds 
Pieper says that humans don’t have umwelt - need to look up more criticisms of this.




“On a daily basis they generally required nothing more than a bowl of bread, milk, ale, water and so on”

Familiars in here, as well.

Time with cat -&gt; “a time that for me becomes fabulous or mythical”
The “autobiographical animal” - human as animal who thinks about themselves.
A history of how man has projected his own failings onto beasts.
Non-human thought, non-human approach - the gaia approach, the ‘thought’ of environments.
The animal as ‘other’.
“The impropriety of a certain animal nuder before the other animal.
“The gaze of a seer, a visionary or extra-lucid one”
“It isn’t the figure of a cat… an allegory for all the cats on earth, the felines that traverse our myths and religions”
Talks about Montaigne’s ‘Apology for Raymond Sebold’ - anti-cartesian, the personhood of animals. 
The otherness of animals, not a different species, but a different sort of person.
“Thinking concerning the animal derives from poetry”
Fights descarte’s separation of animals and humans, that animals cannot think or reply.
“Immense symbolic responsibility” of animals.
“An existence that refuses to be conceptualized”
Long-standing history -&gt; beginning of time - part of our anthropocentric perspective to see animals as ‘other’.
A tension between ‘other’ and ‘approach’ is always there with animals. We always bring animals closer to human.
No binaries between animals and humans.
this phraseology “that which we call animal” instead of the simpler term “animal.” This is purposeful. For Derrida, the fact that we refer to all living creatures that are not human as “animals” is absurdly reductive. He makes a good point. Lumping together the cricket and the whale, the mountain lion and the parakeet, the giraffe and the marmot, seems lazy and dismissive, yet, as Derrida points out, this is exactly what philosophers from Aristotle to Heidegger are guilty of doing. And part of his project is to shine a light on this unexamined assumption.
Cartesian machine-animal

Limitrophy - the gaps and inconsistencies in the assumed binary divide between humans and animals.
I say “might mean” because the word “animal” is always, for Derrida, a stand-in for something that cannot be seized or contained.

Autocosmics can either anthropomorphise (easier) or conceive of the animal on their terms -&gt; much harder.

 Neither Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Levinas, nor Lacan, he claims, has given such sustained attention to the question of the animal. 
“a name [men] have given themselves the right and the authority to give to the living other” 
The’disavowal of the animal has reached ridiculous proportions” - refer to Baudrillard.
Derrida will not participate in the same disavowal and is not afraid to use the words that others may have shied away from--holocaust, genocide--to describe in detail the kinds of violence done to animals through industrial farming or biological experimentation and manipulation, all for the “putative human well-being of man”
Derrida asks how we know that thinking is so different from sniffing or scenting and “why this zone of sensibility is so neglected or reduced to a secondary position in philosophy and the arts?”
Derrida brings humans and animals together in different ways - zoomorphing humanity. This is perhaps why we should use animal/natural models, instead of human models, for agents in games.
The dying of the creature in relation to all of this. Animal ethics is close to my heart, and the themes of this work.
“Animot” - defined as animal only by words.

Animals were already allomorphic at that time - familiars often in the shape of a dog.
To call animals ‘animals’ is to enclose them in a cage.
Autocosmics, therefore, is against Derrida’s position; I am using it here, for ill or well. A moral difficulty on my part.
Autocosmics is the source of the categorization that allows violence against the creature.

Kari Weil

Letting animals be in their being, outside our projects and outside our will for knowledge, would, Derrida seems to suggest, constitute the ultimate ethical stance. As autobiographical animals, however, we may have difficulty, as does Derrida, thinking a principle of life outside of our own projects. What we can do is to track and scrutinize those projects, paying particular attention to how and for what purposes we construct difference. In this way we may turn away from those tracks that trample upon or claim to leave others behind in the assertion of our difference. This is the proto-ethical project that Derrida’s work on the animal undertakes. It is unfortunate that there will not be more to follow.

Do we, he asks, really know the world “as such” and in such a different manner from animals who, Heidegger argues, know the world only in a relation of utility, guided by drives or desires (p. 159)? Might not our language be proof of our own inability to know the world outside of our own projects, outside of our own autobiographical efforts, and not the proof of our true apprehension of the world? -&gt; autocosmics.

“Conceptual simplification”

“Forceful presupposition” that animals and humans are different.

Not saying that autocosmics is unique. Umwelt is a significant demonstration of this.
Think with your arm brain, or your nose brain, perhaps.

Derrida’s book is an autocosmics before the silent cat.

Shame of nakedness is a force of autocosmcis.
Human’s fear of being animal - animalseance
Interested in the gaze - re. Yocto. 
Naming the animal is an othering. It deprives the thing of naming itself - or just an autocosmic marker? For thinking about animals? Still otherness?
We want it to speak, to be humans?
Animals are many and varied.
We deplore our anthropocentrism but we cannot escape.
Animot = a constructive way to use language (and, this, autocosmics) to reframe our relationship with animals as equal and heterogeneous.
Animot = fanciful. A suspension of disbelief. Break us away from pre-conception.
Animot might be a first step to a new, autocosmics.
Who are we following when we follow an animal? We are following ourselves.
Maybe therefore autocosmics/anthropomorphisation is good, to a certain extent. The inclusion of animal in the self.


Tinbergen defines behaviour as “the total movement made by the animal”
TInbergen related to BBAI
Behaviour relates both to external factors and internal “spontaneous” stimuli.
They had quite a mechanistic view of nature
A reservoir of energy fills up and then releases 
Tinbergen’s hierarchical model adds blocks to this - energy moving along through nerve centres in the brain until it reaches a block. These are removed spontaneously.
An interesting way to frame it - needs to do something are removed.
Internal need (to land on flowers) needs external stimuli to remove “blocks” to the behaviour - internal need is goal, blocks are if statements?

Supernormal stimulus seems to support umwelt - if something fake has a stronger characteristic than the real thing, the fake thing will be preferred in execution of the behaviour. Doesnt matter that the rest of it is fake - the rest is believed.

Pieper says humans don’t experience it, but what about superstition? Seeing things? Religion? All these things are part of a human’s umwelt.
Biosemiotics is related to character as envirionment and autocosmics - the signs and meanings of biological systems. Draws on cybernetics.
The nature of SIGNIFICANCE in systems.
Creating meaning in the communication of signs between biological systems.
Sign processes are taken as real - how we interpret the world has meaning and depth.
COmparing biology’s systems to a man-made computer, while differing in certain ways - computers are best-placed to represent the systems of life.
Biological systems are not just physical or mechanistic - they are also qualitative, psychical.
Things grow alongside their own semiotic systems. Semiotic systems (autocosmics) are real.</Text>

Rob's Field Journal

---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
Couldn't wait to get out of town. The NPCs are repeating the same lines I have heard a thousand times. Kitted up with the same sort of thing that I would wear in real life: a backpack and the like. Bought a bow because, unlike Scotland, I'm not safe in the environment. It is a system that is set up not just to be observed, but to react back.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
What systems am I looking at in front of me here? The water, the wildlife (with its 'Radiant AI', flavours of the numinous, the animist), the particles in the air. Each region has its own personality, both in passive observation and active interaction. Perhaps I need to look up examples of those who talk about the landscape personally, who experience it one-to-one, like a conversation or an argument or a fight. Particularly explorers.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
Owls and ravens hooting. I know that they are only sound files, but it makes sense that they would be here. The sound is expansive, polyphonic, binaural. I know where they are.

The looping, randomised animation of trout swimming up the waterfall. Such a simple little animation. The bugs flying at the water's edge. Your curiosity is rewarded; you can pluck them out of the air, a granularity of detail which still shocks.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
I am doing my best to imagine the water as cool, and it is easy. It is a three-dimensional, full-body hint of the real. I can taste it. I think it would be easy to be cynical about this feeling, and I am trying not to be.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
The Radiant AI is easy to interrogate into inadequacy - watching a deer on the shoreline near Riverwood, I started to see the rough edges of its animation, the planar weirdness of its stance, the repetition. I'll try approaching it.

It does run away as you get close - very realistic, very tantalising. You cannot get close to the heart of the system, just like an individual. Things shrink away under too much enquiry, bodging, mindless grokking. Shame on me!





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
A circling bird of prey, high above; the only way I have to interact with it is my bow. It does not react to the near-misses and whistling shafts; I know, from looking at the game code, that it is only a cycling animation. Somebody has released a mod to randomise their wingbeats, so the artifice is not so obvious when there is a pair or more placed above a crag by a designer.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
The character on the other bank of the lake does not wave to me. I am not inside her circle; defined geographically rather than visually. It's interesting: I don't even really want to play in third-person, as my avatar's similarity to the NPCs reinforces the stereotype.

Rather be in a world without people. Totally focussed on the environment, at the expense of myself or my character.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
Even animals are stupid sometimes - red fox running on water, animation too slow - best to interact with literal, peeking, subtle parts of environment as character.

Why am I here? To play? To explore? To observe or participate.

Caves as metaphorical - into the secrets of the mind. The mist at their mouths.

Funny waht the designers decide to put in - working from scratch - the snow blowing off the mountains - goes with what you can't see, I suppose.

Fallen blocks and ruins - the past of the character in evidence.

How deep IS the simulation. IN Skyrim, not very, really. The bits that you can interact with are still highly controlled.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
A domestic character - people want touches of normalcy - the laundry mod.

Chopped down trees - evidence of human activity - the environment carrying the futile characterisation of the actual agent NPCs.

We ignore the depth of the simulation in environment just as we do in a real environment - we look for the rich, crunchy significance of human structure... its arrogant of us. Why is a hut and its accoutrements more meaningful than wildlife? Because it is HUMAN. Or at least more understandable. We cannot process all significance.





---Last Seed, 17th, 4E 201---
Sometimes the animals run towards me - the fox. Sometimes the move through undergrowth as I would imagine.

Am I getting bored doing this?

Things need to happen to you in an environment, as well.


Meaning is diseminated (in Derrida’s sense) through a landscape. Produced as a product of the system, not inherent in any one sign; all interacting together.

I woke up to grey skies, a tinge of green everywhere, as opposed to blue and red yesterday. It has completely changed the environment. The music matches, in the same way it matched something completely different yesterday. I don't know what my interactions with the environment will bring today. 

Cixous' pluralistic, non-impositonary character links with ideas of character as system, as cybernetics; as long as we do not chunk character, and try to own and understand it, we have the same end.





---Last Seed, 18th, 4E 201---
Elements must make sense, in the same way that charactersitics must make sense for characters - why would things be built there? How would this landscape have formed?





---Last Seed, 18th, 4E 201---

---Last Seed, 18th, 4E 201---
The only character I have seen in two days rounds a corner, has no reaction to my presence or my heavily-armed appearance; no social propritries, no ritual; attach is the easiest, and we could model a much more interesting system within the wolves to construct narrative (weighing up hunger vs. numbers).

Does not say anything when he leaves, only walks away. All interactions are either rote, basic or unrelated to environment around him.

Sometimes even the supposedly-advanced combat behaviours are not very good. No animations for warning, rarely run away if outnumbered or hurt. Same animations.

All resources are spread across the whole system, and as characters are only a small part of that, they only get a little bit of attention.

You can use the landscape, but it does not react back to you in a large-scale manner. Too smallscale, you are too insignificant. Character as environment needs this, otherwise it is pointless.

You only realise the larger patterns as you go on; moving in one small area, then get a vista moment; see the profundity of the gorge you are moving through, how it links up to the rest of the landscape. You construct a sort of narrative.


Kendall Walton opposes him. A pretend theorist - we are not literally afraid of these things, we are in fact 'pretending'. It is common sense that we are not really fearing these things.

Dogs in the game make the most snese as we are hard-wired to interact with them, their expressions SEEM to change (we have such a good mental model of a dog that it changes for us) and their behaviour is not all hostile. Hostility breeds misunderstanding and decharacterisation.

Artists create scenes deliberately and with great precision, to demonstrate, symbolise, evoke. A cybernetic artist must do with making systems and hoiping that their artistry lines up with what they want to say, or something meaningful to the player - this affects the kinds of art, and kinds of character, that can be made in computational art.

Believability of a landscape is just as important. Is it any different from character believability? A landscape must flow and move and sit in the same way. Rivers must come from somewhere, and go somewhere as well.

The wolf is stupid; it plunges straight into the stream after me. Wolves do not do this. They would freeze to death.

When character is environment, you are completely immersed, constantly. There are no discreet movements; everything is resonant. In this way, lack of movement or apparent life is not an issue; the life is there, always, subtle.

Human environments are just as important as natural environments in Skyrim - how they sit in the landscape, how they have changed the landscape. They are events, plot, rather than character themselves, it could be argued; but within them are further characters, and plots.



Most followers in Skyrim are sexy dolls. DET focuses on elizabeth - graphical fidelity gets gendered!

Do we need humans to care about a landscape? Nature writing suggests not. It is a mode into which we can inject character, in the absence of anything

Alien isolation environment
No man’s sky

Different ‘environments’ on my Scotland trip - world, scotland, cairngorms, spey valley, inshriach, hollow, bothy, stove - characters within characters, environments within environments.
All environments are self-determined. What makes a landscape individual? Being easily distinguishable, like a mountain or a rock dormation. Anything distinct from that which surrounds it can be a character. The shadowy grove. The fallen tree. All environments are part of other environment. 
Cities have character
Famous characterful environments from vbooks (I.e. Mordor) Can rarely tell with Tolkien if he is talking about a place or a person. 
Placing you into a character, like into an environment, to make that character resonant.
Like an environment, a character has their inputs and outputs. 
CRIT- characters have motivation, but do environments? We ascribe motivation to them.
The parasites - by clustering, they form a new environment, like ferns around a brook. 
We do not appreciate a landscape when we have to enfure it as full humans. 
I wish my feet made no noise - they do not have to, in videogames! You can glide through without body. Volume controls.
Environments do not change at a human rate - a character is an environment sped up.
We tend to think of imagination as expansive, but it can also be reductive.
Frost left in the hollow of the bothy - a system providing characterisation.
I saw plants covered in tiny ells
If you really look, the birch are shedding their leaves so quickly, ticking a weird clock on the roof.
To relate to it as humans, we must speed it up, focus, divide; we can do this in games.
Rubbing trees like tghe taught, slightly warm, downy legs of creatures o adults.
Environmentalism is a character study.
The woodpecker’s song is on a human timescale - not too irregular, not regular enough to be mechanical.
Learning the train timetables by nature as they go through the valley.
From afar, a landscape can be characterised - up close, it takes on the peaks and troughs of your body’s performance. This is similar to the concept of aesthetic distance. The explorer understands themselves better, and the environment as it is; this is a different understanding from the witness of landscapes, the reader about landscapes.
I got very weird and superstitious about leaving any of my possessions (the pen Ilost in the gorge) out on the mountainside - leaving a piece of myself vulnerable)
I built a characterful sound map of all the sounds in the bothy’s vallete.
It has its own familiars!
Fire curving covetously around the logs
Waking up at the same time every day - attuning to a different system.
My focus is natural environments but this applies to urban environments as well. (Iain sinclair, richard mabey and the like)
Allows us to look at character through a cybernetic lens
The forest beast - squealing like a brontosaur, high-vis brain, clear markings that I understood - I stalked it through the woods. A white skull of a car by the road.
Natural theology - the natural world as angel or devil.
Partiality is key to characterisation - we need to reduce - the sillouhette or the big shadows are waht is captured.
The creature is even more partial as it has been decapitated.

Lots of problems with using gamemaker - room-based approach makes texture-swapping inevitable.

Kismet (Cynthia Brazeal)

MIT - &quot;a robotic head that's able to interact with  humans in a human-like way through myriad facial expressions, head positions, and tones of voice.&quot;
A sociable machine that is not a expert system - uses social structure to understand learning. We can use the social structure to inform narrative. Not interested in learning.
It has to be social - if it is going to learn from people - people will want to teach it, because of autocosmics. Both for the robot's sake and human's. All specialised for sending and recieving social cues (autocosmics)
Using human subjects - do they find the interaction satisfying/pleasurable?
Expressive abilities to show that it has learnt what you said.
Commenting on all this with the illness of the creature.
“Kismet is a social robot designed to socially interact with humans. Its underlying architecture includes an attention system responsible for directing the robot’s eyes toward stimuli that satiate its social and stimulation drives. In order to determine the most salient objects in the environment and thus determine the robot’s focus of attention, three visual features are considered: motion saliency, color saliency, and face pop-outs. A saliency map is derived for each of these features. These maps are then combined with a habituation function (which helps decrease the saliency of attended objects so that the robot’s eyes can be directed to other location) using a weighted sum. The specific weight given to each saliency map is adjusted based on the status of Kismet’s drives. For example, if the stimulation drive needs to be satiated, the color saliency map is enhanced because color is characteristic of toys. Similarly, when such drive is over-stimulated, the color saliency is suppressed. The combination process generates a global attention activation map, which is finally used to direct the robot’s attention and display consistent emotional facial expressions.”
Kismet’s emotions are designed to provoke sympathy from human agent.

            <Title>Animism</Title>
            <Text>
In Japan, anything which appears impressive inspires a sense of awe, or exhibits a life0force. 


“Currently, personhood is often treated symbolically rather than factually - as an honorific, a promise to pretend that an entity is a person.” 




Japanese attribute souls to lots of different things - “non-human entities possess a spiritual essence” (animism) - “animism rejects cartesian”

OOP is animist - ascribing objectivity to concepts - you are defining the limitations of your reality. 

An animist approach to design - everything embued with life - little pantheons

Panpsychism - universally regarded with skepticism, if not outright scorn (IEP on qualia)
But animism is not insisted on objective consciousness - it is a performance of consciousness in other beings for personal beenhit.

Turkle - “can tell the difference between animals and machines even if the machines appear to move by themselves” - therefore the psychological life is most important. 
Turkle’ research reveals that we have a fluid ideal of alive - that we can create mental spaces fo consensus when we know something is not alive but can react to it as if it were - “[the children] seemed to be aware that this was a middle ground of some kind.”
“Do they maintain such a distinction (between alive and not) when confronted with creatures that defy our usual expectations.” 
Are we confused by what is alive and what isn’t? - not necessarily, but in the magic circle it seems to have the same effect on us.

Link between transportation and flow in games.


Social Presence Theory (SPT) was originally defined by Short, Williams, and Christie (1976) as,
“the degree of salience of the other person in the interaction and the consequent salience of the
interpersonal relationships.” A more modern definition of social presence theory was refined by
Gunawardena (1995) to state, “the degree to which a person is perceived as a ‘real person’
in mediated communication.”

This is important for robots - a marker of 'quality'? Does it have any use in 
Can either be about emotional connetion (lowenthal 2010) or someone being perceived as being 'there' or real.
Similar to identification theory in art. This is more for technology and autocosmics in technology.

Transportation theory thus suggests that (a) the phenomenology of me-
dia enjoyment can be characterized as a flow-like state, (b) positive con-
tent is not a necessary condition for enjoyment, (c) the personal “safety”
of a narrative world, even when characters encounter trials, may be a
basic underpinning of enjoyment of stories, and (d) enjoyment may stem
from the exercise of fundamental empathic abilities that allow us to
connect with others, an idea to which we return in the following section.

A key question - how simple can we make a virtual character and still have it be evocative?
Because the interaction with Heider and Simmel is pretty minimalistic.


n an influential article (Gunawardena &amp; Zittle, 1997), social presence was found to be a
significant predictor of audience satisfaction within a computer-mediated form of
communication, contributing about 60% of the variance. Richardson and Swan (2003) also
found that overall perceived learning was predicted by perceived social presence in online
courses.

Related to autocosmics.

It is, in gunawardena' description, about 'perception'

oatley - coherence truths important in any simulation (1999) - about pattern matching (for games) not about rleation to the world.
simulations of fiction allow 'personal truths' to be explored -&gt; emtional response, understand aspects of themselves.
BUT games are about indentification a lot of the time?


There is still little agreement on how to measure social presence SPRES and SPPQ
self-reporting social presence scale.


'Parasocial' relationships.

Parasocial relates to imaginary friends etc. lots of this sort of stuff in here.

Comebacks to Walton - Noel Carroll &quot;disanalogies&quot; with games -&gt; we can't turn our emotions from books off, unlike in games when children can.
&quot;the ritual act has all the formal and essential characteristics of play... transports the participants to another world&quot;.
Superstitious practices have a sensation of interaction to promote causality - like games.

But can we harness all of this in art? Because games are acted out, are used, is the fictional circle weaker to start with, and so we have to look outside the arts for things like pareidolia, magical thinking etc.

Point out that different sorts of media allow for different sorts of transportations, which may suit different readers.

oatley - Just as computer simulations can help us get to grips with complex problems such as flying a plane or forecasting the weather, so novels, stories and dramas can help us understand the complexities of social life.” - can games do this as well?</Text>

Like language, games promote fictionality and virtuality
Discover their own &quot;narrative language&quot; (Ryan) since their inception.


every new technology of communication inspires novel combinations: printing allowed the wide distribution of illustrated books, and later of comics; photography gave birth to photonovels; cinema integrated animated images, music, spoken language and occasionally written text, and digital technology added interactivity to the many modes of film.

The affordances of language, pictures, movement, and music complement each other, and when they are used together in multi-modal media, each of them builds a different facet of the total imaginative experience


Even so, the narrative incompleteness of images is a powerful generator of curiosity. - far more than a normal narrative. A simulation without language is just so.

Narrating without language (Laure Ryan) - games do this, surely? Ryan says that it is to degrees, and either uses a bit of language (in a title) to suggest narrative, or is a story already known to the user and must be - i disagree with thus, look at autocosmics! We build stories out of nothing.Unless they are just pictoral narrative- must have some sense of temporality. Time is important to narratives. Monophase (static) and ployphase (moving) pitctures (Wolf).

Leeuwen and Kress have brought the term 'multimodality'. But mine is also a transmedia approach.

BArthes and Bremond wanted to open up narratology to other media - Were he alive today, he would add blogs, hypertext, and video games. (Marie Laure Ryan)
Under the influence of Genette, narratology developed as a project almost exclusively devoted to literary fiction.

For videogames - In the U.S., Bolter &amp; Grusin (1999) proposed the concept of “remediation” to explain the relations between different media. In their view, every new technology-based medium must be understood, in the context of other media, as an attempt to “remediate” their limitations and get closer to the elusive goal of “achieving the real.”

Video games, for instance, remediate film by incorporating narrative techniques commonly used in cinema within an interactive environment

Wolf's 'intermediality' - the relationships between new forms and old. In videogames.

in Wolf's terms, what I am doing is plurimediality and transmediality.

For the narratologist, channel-type media are only interesting to the extent that they involve “differences that make a narrative difference”—in other words, to the extent that they function as both conduits and “languages.” - Marie Laure Ryan, we can take computers as this, then!

Empathy- It is quite automatic - relies mainly on non-verbal communication - suits the expressiveness of games, then.

Bickmore and Pickard - Come back to them later when they say that human expectation in a virtual agent is so high, it must be tempered to a certain degree - controlled by the author and context of the work (in chapter 2).

Can games fulfill Calvino’s idea of a novel written outside the self?


&quot;aesthetic illusion is therefore a transmedial, transmodal and transgeneric phenomenon&quot;
