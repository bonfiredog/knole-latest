## General To-Dos

### *(For Each Section)*
- Cut, do not add!
- Be more narrow/specific about my project, rather than making **broad, sweeping statements**.
- Add headers to each page for navigation.
- Remove all underlining.
- Constantly relate back to originality about my work.
- **Constantly relate back to research question, specifically referring to it often:**

> "How might a character in computational art maintain their defining quality of dynamic agency within a system, while achieving the 'resonant' qualities of characters in more static art-forms?"

- Check all references.
- Does this need a thesis fig to illustrate it? Does that fig already exist, or does it need to be created?
- Lower-case project.
- Get rid of masterbeast - just 'the installation'
- Remove hashes from Appendix names.
