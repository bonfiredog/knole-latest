- A cipher for exploring a part of our imaginations. Use them to try things out, to ‘play’.
- They are “sources of comfort in times of boredom or loneliness.”
- “Serves as a conscience.”
- Linked to this idea of ‘self-expansion’ in literature.
- As Oatley said about books: imaginary friends, like toys, a pre-literary tools for empathy.

- Most are human, and have a life of their own away from children; not just explaining phenomena around them, then, but imagining and simulating a whole universe. Where does the ‘text’ lie, in the loosest sense?
- Children usually understand that they are not real. A ‘consensus’; a form of play, of fiction, of permitted simulation. Like literature. Ordained and culturally-assimilated ways of being for children.

[Briefly]
Why looking at this? Because you can characterise familiars, characters like Yocto, as ‘imaginary friends’: especially with this ‘post-religious’ stuff. Bring in some of the Superstition stuff as a basis for this argument?

- An example of autocosmic characterisation “in the wild”. A guided characterisation, a limited sphere, for a specific psychological purpose.
- Linked to a discussion of toys. Children’s conception of the world, rooted in Piaget’s childhood studies. Dampened by Gjersoe’s studies, though not by much.  
- Once we became a post-religious society, passed the ‘need’ for imaginary friends onto children (Victorian Age).




- Usually have disappeared by the age of 10. Usually it is societal pressure makes us lose them, but some people have imaginary friends into adulthood. A surprisingly high number. In adults, having one often comes from low self-esteem. They “look inside themselves and find comfort”. Call it a ‘presence’ or a ‘companion’. I am interested in this change, precisely because the phenomena tied to autocosmics are so often exposed to ridicule as being ‘for kids’. This, I hope, will show the link between adult and child autocosmics. Yes, they might be different, and to different degrees, but they come from the same human need which is satisfied in very different ways, and legitimised in very different ways. As Gjersoe says, we do not ‘grow up’ and leave these things behind; we exist on a ‘continuum of irrational belief’.
