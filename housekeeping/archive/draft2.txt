And before anything had happened one of us was born every year, for the number of years equalling our number, until there were none of us left to be born. Every year of those years was dry until the last, and almost empty of a circumstance

From the first year, or so it said, came Neverill, which is very quiet of its speciality; which seems to like being enveloped, and lying back and watching; The One Who Peers From Mattresses, which would not tell us that it was our eldest by its years, but which we all know, even if we argued about it; which knew far more things than we did, even if those things were never more than four. The secret thing it knew was that in the year that it was born, something underneath it finished dying, and it found this unbearable: and so it became it masked its face from darkness, and resolved to be its tomb. In all the years that I have known it, it has never turned over to see what it has done. Neverill has no secrets, despite its beady silence: it told us its shame immediately. 

I had a body made for luing down; this always worried it, and it ate very little.

In the second year there happened Ml, the leggy-eyed, which is the swift runner through wood - its eyes go through every plank. We did not see him as much as the others.
