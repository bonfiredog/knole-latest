- 6  It were the hottest day of the yeer to that Date when the Spyrit arrived, and I had not thought of the hearth since the March gone. It were approaching after luncheon at the Industry, and it had been a big dinner of rabbit cut so small as I like it, with the legs given to the children, and so we sat dully like washed spoons at our stations. And Mssr Cromford (being the Warden) had been to a soilwarp in Nighcester (who has since died of the flu, she fixed his problems)) about his flu, and been told instead that some Witch who haunts a place called leeds was weaving storm clouds and posting them south. And so he changled past us and we whispered 'Fool' at him, for there had not been a cloud in months, yet he shut up and bolted every shutter on every floor, and we were not to unhasp anie of the machines until he had done so, and it took him an Hour; and soon we were in a murk like the light of a candle through a thumb. James Godshelp fell down insensible on that Afternoon, as he always does on hot afternoons, and his children found him and lay down in sympathy. I had not yet met Mss Charlotte, now my deerest Friend, and when I told her of this day she were appalled at Mssr Cromfords credence; and I told her of how we all dreamt of crossing the baked sugar of the yard to the Big House, where Charlotte was, and fynding that small door in its side where it neer faces the sun, and it is always tasty cool and damp (imbecile heat); and Charlotte then told to me how afeered she might of been, of fynding us all their, in our dreams, waiting for her there; but how she would have greeted me at the big doors, which so usual will onlie open for her Father, like the mansions of the Moon; and how she would have held me to her there, and swept me up (for she is much stronger than me, having meat every day and hot food), despite the bale-dust about me like dander, and she would have told me about her suitor that month, and we would have much agreed that he had fair-neer killed her. Heat running in lines like the signature of the devil. And yet I had not Charlotte in those days, and had seen her but dimly through the dust when her Father would tour her, and men like you, through the factory, or across the yard when we would stand for Christmas or the Crown on the day the War began. And there were manie thing which trouble me that day, and that were coming worse, but I profess that it were Johns hand which made me run. 
It is common for Mssr Knole to have husband and wyfe work together at their station, for it keep us honest and Reveal to us the beauty of each others Concentration. Yet it works little, as everyone is bent upon their work and sees not their partner there. John and I worked the spinners, one on either side of a tall wooden backing placed there to stop the machinery of different stations entangling, and so we were divided. John is a fool for patterns, and saw it as a Sign concerning Love or some other thing; and when he spied that there were a most natural knothole in the wood between us, his Symbol grew without Meaning to. And that morning, with the shutters shut and James falling down and the lunchtime oil in my throat and all my other Troubles, to see his three white fingers, ringless (for safety) and trimmed (for safety) and thick, squeezed through that knothole, the splinters mattering not, seeking Reassurance, as if we were prisoners; it was in this that I ran. They were like the mouths of fledglings whinging to be fed, and I felt sudden very Ill, and I rose and went to the stair.
 Had to be done by hand if no water. None of the floor saw me, for they were drowsy bent to their work, and as any mill worker will tell you, no machine has you looking at the stars. Mssr Cromford was on the roof, looking north. Though it had been boiled inside, outside I was seared like a rib; for Nature will neer get it quite right, will she? I climbed the switchback, as you  have done this day, and entered the village as I had left it that early morn, with everybody else; yet now I returned alone. This were a very Queer feeling, for in the Day the village is neer Empty, and I passed the houses unlocked of every One. Aside from my Fathers house, and the Church, I have neer stepped inside anie one; not een Sarah and Josephs, though I have been invited manie Times. When I was smaller I believed that onlie my father had the Tools to hollow stone, and that they were only boulders shaped by the wynd, and that those that entered them were onlie playing at entering them. Yet upon that day I remember, perhaps for the last tyme, a girlish Curiosity, tearing aside from my Sickness and Displeasure, to step inside each and every one and see the weak luxuries that they had accrued. It were a Profane sense, and it gave me a peculiar Density about my middle to sense it, and I did not Succumb to it, but made straight for home, as you now have, with my own Instruction.
