- She knows that birds do not appreciate nature.
- I knead it (where?) when I am worried - plot wound (a bruise? Permanent?)
- My dreams have no mystery - I do not interpret dreams - not lyke a prophecy.

- This bird was crafty - he did not move about so fast like something natural, but took his time like a general.
- She does not know the names of birds.
- The birds she likes more, as they do not have this unbroken connection to the land -0 free - but do not go wither - stick to their paths, and do love to come indoors.

- It sleeps like a beast - more about it sleeping
