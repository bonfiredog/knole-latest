- Sarah and Joseeph used to drop in on the Olf.
- Olf has a big neck and head - call him Mssr Cuckoo - tired to get rid of him - but the compassion of the court
- supported by the knoles
- whop would come and examine him
- he is very short, not hairy 
- cleft toes
- upward slanting eyes - weird tongues
- Whistle without a pea that could call the devil.
- A shrew-whip.
- He had a welsh door, through which he could cause figures to knock ("what they called a")
- draws a really crappy pentagram as a symbol
“To get away from his wife, Cleopatra of Rhodes, who none of us ever saw. and neer came to church.”
Sometimes the priest seems to take the olf under his wings, sometimes he ignores him.
- "cutting" somebody from their grave.
- a  man killed by violence shall wander in his grave at night, not walking, but the grave moving - and coming to rest somewhere else at night - and croci shall grow around their grave.
I do not blame the Olf, because he is a beast.
she mentions as an aside all of them being killed. (Warburg) – he would have died anyway

5 See you by the garden of this a Womans things about the door, brush and wheel, and yet no Woman waiting; and a Mans things about the roof, caulk and rush and iron tools, and yet no Man. Yet there withyn the garden, I seer, there will be something in between them, and in Trinity with something else entire; an Apparition living, unless his Parents have taken their Fortune in my Absence and returned to Slay him, as they proclaimed they would upon the day He was born. This be the Olf, and you shall not Stare, for he shall Chase you if he sees you staring; and though he run not fast, for God has seen fit to give to him a pair of narrow hoofs, in place of feet, I have never known him Tire when he hath something he covets. If the wether is Fair, you may spy a mingling of Unfortunates at his Wall – holding their babies blue as bruises – clasping their elbows like babies – bending their wensome necks like elbows. You shall see that they remove their Boots by hys Gate, for it has been said that Iron from their nailes shalle burn Hym – though I have seen him bite cream from a spoon upon St. Severus' Day. When he were coming to two yeers Ma Cubb visyted with hys Mother and hys Father, and held a nail to hym, and he cried (for she had been seen holding it in the river aforehand) and proclaimed him elf-born, and that their real and handsome boy, who would have Grown to sell Paper in the Citie, she proclaimed, was gone into the Bogs. I shall credit that he looke fair like an Elf, with that smile, and the hexish way that everybody takes to Him, despite them Selves – and how the Poore come to Hym despite them Selves, and paye hym in the Wonts they think of an Elf – in jars full of night air, or the fished scream of a coney, or yards of bramble, and whych he all takes very happily, and claps them on the back, and says always Mother! And takes them withyn to Please them.

6 If he has no Custom (as is Often now), He shall approach you, and attempt to Hold you – thys you maye have to Allow, yet He always smells very Pure – and after some Moments, you may Placate hym with half of that Hair  whych I did have you Cut afore you came, which he shall play with like a Hoop. Take you care never to give to hym aniething Other, nor smyle for more than a Passing – for if you do you shall like I enter into a Lifelong Thing with hym, which Distance shall not stymy, and which shall need tending always like a grate or a calf. If you tell him your Busynes, you are Lost; for He shall tell to you that He knows my Spyrit, and that they have Manie Friends in Common, and sit beside Each other in the Parliament of Fairies and swap Luncheons – then shall He tell unto you every stick of Furniture and every Bolt of wall withyn my Fathers house – yet no mattre how Precise the Tell, you shalle never let him withyn my Doore. Onlie perform for you his Trick (see withyn), upon eache Wednesday, and he shall let you be, in a Friendship which shall neer change.
