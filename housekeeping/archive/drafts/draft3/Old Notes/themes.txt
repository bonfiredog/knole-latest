NATURE
-------
Anne sees Nature as bad, as unmodern, backward, dangerous and dull. It is particularly useless in the 'modern age' because most people do not work outside anymore.  She is enamoured with her limited contact with the modern age. She is particularly scared/disdainful of liquids and water, which she sees as carriers of disease and 'sperpents', the spermal element which causes pregnancy. Water is particularly bad because it is controlled by Gravity, which she personifies as evil, rapine and with intent. Gravity, being 'grave', is what causes pregnancy.

INDOORS/OUTDOORS
-----------------

Anne hates to be out of doors, and likes the modern civility of homes, such as hers which her Father built well. Though she has rarely left the village, she does occasionally - most recently to go to Nighthead for the trial. Men are always abroad out of doors, she says.

HER REPUTATION
---------------

Because of the trial, the village is driving her out - everybody now thinks that she has a Devil in her house, despite the courts not convicting her because they refuse to accept that a Devil could have caused the death of a cow. Her reputation has spread far and wide, however - she has had people of all social ranks visiting with her, with their own concerns. She became rather rich, and has taken all of her money and possessions with her - using some money to have Mssr Cryer print her words. She calls her clients 'Subscrybers' as well. She hates the ballad about her. Consequently, many things have been said of her, particularly about her promiscuity (owing, now, to her pregnancy), whereas she sees herself as a victim of Nature. She is defiant in the face of them, but must leave to protect herself. She is dismissive of the ballads they write about her. She writes the Housekeeping in order to pass on her work to somebody else, that somebody else pursues the 'troth' of it, and to vindicate herself in the eyes of the Law - that she is not useless, and she is not promiscuous, and importantly not a witch. She is bitter about being forced out of her home, and of being a victim of Gravity, but resolute that the 'Troth' will out, Sarah and Matthew will be avenged, and she will come to be vindicated. You will know about me - the cow died wrongly, as my method was wrong. She did do it, she wants you to know, but it does not make her a witch - I am doing great work.

THE SUBSCRYBER
--------------

The Housekeeping is addressed to a lady in Sheffield that she has dreamt of. She does not want to sell it generally, but Cryer advertises it for sale more broadly to the discerning lady, though he is careful to say that it is only for entertainment. Anne wants to give it to a woman, rather than a man, and to give to her the secrets over Nature, and for dominion over. They share the dangers of Gravity, she can understand Anne better than a man could, and is better suited to indoors work 

PREGNANCY
---------
Anne is also leaving the village, partly, because of the pregnancy that has occurred in recent months. She does not know who the father is, because she has always been very careful to avoid gravity. She does not think it could be her husband, but according to her theories it could be anybody that she has had contact with. She will raise it on her own. She makes some conjecture as to who the father is, but she has no way of proving it (thus, she cannot stay and beg to be kept). Looking after the child will mean that she can no longer do her duties with the creature.

WORK AT THE MILL
----------------
Until she started earning good money from the creature, Anne worked at the local cotton mill, where she operated one of the early spinning machines - what she calls a "Station", just as the creature is a "Station". This is what defines her method with the creature, her outlook on Nature; she is proposing a new Method, separate from Nature, using her 'unnatural creature' as the interface ("a creature beyond gravity"). She signed a "compack" of work when she started there (just as she signed with the creature on the day it appeared) and her whole day is spent following patterns that she does not understand the underlying system of - only the output. The mill is run by Mssr Knole, a methodist who follows the teachings of Wesleyanism (no church on the Sabbath, charity, field preaching). The language in the recipes is contractual, legalistic, and the only structure that she uses is the working week. 

TRUTH/ENLIGHTENMENT/THE MODERN AGE
----------------------------------
As a result of her work at the mill, Anne is wrapped up in the economic outputs of the Enlightenment, and so has great respect and admiration for the modern age, only rivalled by her disdain for nature, 'peasantly' work, and the outdoors. She believes in the pursuit of 'Troth', empirical evidence (that which you can see before you), and hates Misteries. which she has heard of from some of her Subscrybers. She believes in the truth and utopianism of everybody working together in the mill, and there being no tensions - though, as her recipes show, there are still plenty of issues in that department. She believes in exactness and never obscruing anything - her co-opting of the Subscryber has shown that she is desperate not to be seen as a Liar. In the modern age, with its pursuit of Truth, to be a liar is only beaten by being mistaken in something. She believes in the Troth and Power of the Law, and the Courts, despsite what it has done to her. She got this knowledge from ancient sources, and her training at the mill, and have had men of great renown help her (she thanks them in the recipe titles). They have removed uncertainty from their lives. The idea of Truth, observation is tied to the views you get up on the moor, the fact that you can see for miles and nothing is hidden or mysterious any more. She just says that she sees things, and that's the truth - but what you see isn't always true, the surface isn't all of it. The creature is an interface of truth. She is revealing the truth as he knows it - the knowledge is there plain to see, no more mysterys. Uses viewsome but of course is very similar to picturesque - you can't always see the truth in evidence.

NIGHTHEAD
---------
Nighthead is a modern village - built to go with the mill. Her father built it, and she is pleased to live there. The houses are well-made, and keep out nature.

HER HUSBAND
-----------
John is now a minor character - she is leaving him, and will not leave him the house, because it was her Fathers house

HER FATHER
-----------
Again, many of the sub-plots have gone now - he was a mason, who built the village and their House. She did his contracts and compacks, which provided the basis for her modern, capitalist outlook. He worked with his hands, and helped people - she wants to do this as well. Still the murder subplot?

THE MAIN 'TRIAL' THREAD
------------------------
This is the main thread now. Sarah and Joseph, who have looked after Anne since she was small, have their son killed by Awlbatch who he thinks is poaching. In revenge, they ask Anne to use the Spirit to kill Awlbatch, but they succeed in only killing one of his cows. After the evidence of some others who hear them doing the recipe, they are tried (even though they were nowhere near the cow) for theft and damage of property, which carries the death sentence. Anne is not tried because they will not admit that witchcraft works (even though they are admitting a causal link between the couple and the dead cow), but people now believe that she is a witch, and the creature a Devil, and she must leave for her own safety.

AWLBATCH
--------
Awlbatch is the 'enemy' of the piece - the poor yet Romanticised farmer who is terrified of poachers and his small flock of Cows up on the hill, and who not only killed Robin (she played with him when she was very small) but also got Sarah and Matthew killed. She feels that she has fixed the recipe now, and you can kill him, if you know where he will be. She includes his schedule so that you can target him. Always romanticised by the rich.

CREATURE AS LANDSCAPE/MACHINE
------------------------------
Anne sees the creature as an idealised landscape - no mites or animals, unnatural completely sterile, and one which she feels she can understand utterly. Of course, just as she does not understand her Station at the mill, she only understands the creature superficially - but she feels that she has complete dominion over it, and can act as a learned 'guide' for the Subscryber when she comes to claim the house. It is a machine to be used, she says - not like a fairy or a demon, but a passive, unemotional creature, a new type of animal that can be used. She speaks sometimes about other parts of its body, which obviously you can no longer reach. She speaks about its smell (unnatural), and says that it is completely without emotion, needs no rest or food, and only needs some water left in a bowl, like a machine needs oil. She says that it is always dry to the touch (therefore safe for women), is immortal and shall not die and is an indoor thing, whereas most fairies and defils are out in the world. He is installed in her wall, like an appliance - appeared there to help her. She follows a 'Method', just like she follows a 'Method' with her 'Station' at the mill.
