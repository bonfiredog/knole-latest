## Tweaks

- **Cankers Spreading**: Look at the mechanism by which this happens currently. They increase the rate at which he dies. Put a gradient fade on top of cankers, if not done already.
- **Alembick**: Rub on caul nub or lip to get water up (very slowly). Level tied to lust, mostly.
- Any vocalisation causes pain.
- Closing eyes in pain lasts for shorter time (but happens more frequently as pain goes up).
- More of a 'puff' of blood when horn is pulled out.
- Eyes don't fade until it is fully gone, and then wink out.
- Wens come up more frequently as you touch it.
- Eyes get redder if don't blink.
- Place more scars/cuts, in line with recipes: **to determine**

## Recipe To Dos

- During canker recipe, cankers can be placed anywhere - mingling with the skin. Only for a few second (first touch after end of recipe)
- **Bells**: Begins work at the sixth bell. How does it react to the bells? Implementing the bells -
- **Psalms**: The reading of psalms in the morning. Tied to a time - must be the right one, otherwise...
- **Recognising the charms**: Individually, or as a whole?
- **Expecting to go to lunch at particular times**: begs to go on the day it isn't allowed.
- **Looking for his supper**: 
- Rearrange console to look like star.
- Pressing on the throat gives him a cough (inflames, effects the voice, drops the pitch a bit)
- Finding Someone/Something: the red mark corresponds not randomly, but where you have pressed him before (correlation)
- Using the MMM (from the handkerchief):
- Winking/matthew winking. 
- The thyme
- It does have a season.
- Everything stops when weather goes.
  Asking him to show you lost things upsets him, he refuses
