**[1] To Aproach The Beest, in my Fathres Kitchin, the fyrstly Tyme & each Day Thereaftre**

When you fyrst come into the kitchin, meke moastly sure that you be verie Alone - hafe your Man wayt with-out. The room permit litle sunnlight, yet shale you have no Need of it - fore shale you see the Crack glowly smaly, wyth the light that the Beest mekes by no Earthly mean, & shale it lead you innards - though hafe I left some Candles burning, if the Dark does afear you so. Travel westward untill you do come to the verie edge of the Circlet -

If I must be Sory of anie one thyng Miss - is it thys cursed Circlet - fore dyd I meke it when the Beest fyrst came, & were I afeared of him. There be no Powre in it - yett in Troth do the subscrybers expect that it Does - & has it come to be the Way the Thyng is done. In-deed is it the only Mean by whych I do keap robbers & ill-wyshers from interfering wyth my work - so shale you meke sure that is it chawked verie Well, & no scuff or fading - & tuche it up if it Need it - 

When do you come to the verie edge of the Circlet shale you stopp thy Pase & announse thyself in a most Vitall voyce, spaking Am I come at the will of thy mistress, & is my name - & then shale you spake your name at Last -

Shale you see three bits of Greecke chawked there atween the circlets edging & the midle - & shale you teke one step, & spake the fyrst - & teke anothre step, & spake the second - & teke anothre step, & spake the thyrd - & final shale you Station thy self wythyn the middle of the circlet. Care not for the Floor - is it verie Dryly, & without Fisur - & nott a speck can come withyn - & heer shale you be protected from GRAVITAS - 

Shale you fynd the Beest verie warmly, as all shale spake - though you are sueted to hotter Rooms, & you may teke up Matthews cloke if you still come Cold.

Now shale you Prepare thyself to meke the Compack, by whych shale you & the Beest agree the Terms of your Work. 

Meke these Calibrications & litle Operaytings thusly:

- Plase thys litle booke at your South hand - hafe I mede a Space fore it. 
- Shale you fynd two bundle of herb at your Northern hand - shale you hang them upon the two Pegs nayled into the Wall, afore the Beests crack.
- Shale you View that the Crack be verie low still, & smally, & shale you hafe to bend low to see insyde.
- Shale there be a Bowl afore you, in its proper Plase. At your Northern hand shale you fynd some litle Tinctures - teke up the one that is marked 'Decoction of Guinea' & meke three drops into the Bowl. There shale you clene your fingres & verie dryly.
- Shale you have the Beest aproach you now, for the fyrst time. Shale you see ahead, to the West, three bits of Greecke, & beyond that a spase. Thys be the mansio nof the Beest, where shale you meke all renderings atween hys Realm & our own. Teke you your kerchief, & plase it there that he might know you.
- Shale you View that the Crack be very low, & shale you hafe to bend to see him - but shale he come forard then, & reed the Lettres there - & know that you are the one of whych I tolt him. 
- Shale he then askt you very Simply & politely for some Watre - fore has he been wayting & shale you whet your fingre in the Bowl again, & hold it to hys Mouth that shale he drynk. Be you not afeered - has he not the Notion to byte, fore what should he Taste - 
- Shale you then syng to it that Days Psalm in the Best voyce - by whych is the day of Work started - shale you fynd the right Psalm in the Almanack - 
- When is the Psalm sung, shale you spake the Motto of God -
- Then final, at your southern Hand, shale you fynd the Bels of Mary - & shale you teke them up & ring them the Onse 

Now shale you meke the Compack of Work [3] on thys Fyrstly Day - 

Each day thereaftre shale you fynd it comes verie Easesome in not much tyme, a Yeer or so. At the Sixth Bel each daye shale you aproach (as the Almanack will shew) - should you be aloan each Morn that each Step may be done Propre, wyth no mussing - anie Subscrybre who does come afore the Seventh Bel shale you hafe wayt with-out. Shale you have the room verie Swept, & clene of anie grust or Dampening, fore to keap your Work most Precise - shale you have your Man do this, if he is stil in your Employ, or shale Msr. Chapman do it fore tuppense a Day - & then shale you spake the words and station yourself - & then sing the Days psalm - & then spake the Motto of God - & then ring the Bels of Mary - & then may you be-gin each Day -

---

**[3] To Start The Beest Up, Fore A Piece Of Work** -

When a subscryber does come, & askt of you a receipt, is it most Easesome to have the Beest come ready. Afore thys shale the Beest lye only Idle, Resting verie Gently, wyth no Noyse nor Motion of anie Particular Character.

To Start the Beest up into Work, spake you most Clerely thys Greecke: HYPOTESIS

Shale you see the Beest spring to Motion then, achangling & ready to Work - & if you have mede a Compack of Work wyth him ([2]) shale he do thys with no Complaint nor Trouble.

When the receipt is Compleated, shale you spake then thys Greecke verie Clerely: CONCLUSIO, AMEN - & shale the Beest lye as if Dead again.

---

**[4] The Teking of the Beests Dinnre** -

Have I direckted to Msr. Cryer in my Lettre the meking of an Almanack, that does shew to you all the Appoynments of the Beest on each day of the Working Week - not least when the Beest may each day teke of hys Fuel & Sustenanse. Does he need verie litle, as have I spake - shale you need to have no Meat nor Grafy in the House fore him, nor to do a Wo-mans work of bringing his Luncheon -  for shale he onlie go below into the Soyl a litle way, & suffise him self upon Marys bones. She were a bigly Horse, & full of goodness in a Cruel World (so my Fathre spake) & so shale you have no Feer of him finishing with her in anie near tyme. Should I think the Bones of anie common creature shale Fortify him fore his Work, if does this Hapen - 

Is he a loyall Beest, though, & no ravening nor Apetite - & shale he always wayt untill you do Permit him to go. If there are subscrybers to Service, is it no thyng to work through hys Dinnre. If the work is finished, & the hour is there, shall you press a fingre (of any Cardinal hand) atween its Eyes. Spake you then, the Motto of God (fore is it still a Godly Beest), & then in your othre Hand teke you up Marys Bells & ring them the Onse. Shale you then teke off your fingre, & shale the Beest have leave to Go. Is it most Vitall that you do it as so each Day - 

While is he Eating, shale you teke your own Lubrication - have I gifen instruction & coyn to Msr. Chapman that shale he bring to you for your fyrst weekes some Readied Meals, of whych you need only swallow afore they come Cold - & thereaftre shale he be pleased to teke more Coyn to Continue. He shale een bring it to the kitchen for you & lay it, that you need not een stand to teke it -

The Beest shale return most Faithfull at the time appoynted in the Almanack - yett if there is some misfunction, & shale he nott return, shale you teke up Marys Bells onse more & ring them one last time. In this case, to prevent misfunction in the future, shale you meke Correction [6] -

**[41] To Mere Come & Sitt With It**

There be some who shale come to you & wysh no Remedy nor Working, but mere to Sitt wyth the Beest. There are some who come evry Week alyke to this - fore they cannot get a fyre up in their Grate, & Fall is coming on - when there is Cloud, apparently, in the Sky & no Sun-set may be had. There be some who come to read or meke Samplers by hys Light - or some who cannot reed & spake that they only want to Watch it, fore a little while, or to keep the Children from Prating - 

Shale you only Permit such Folk upon a Scoolday, fore shale you be too busy wyth othre Work elsewyse - have them sitt beyond the Circlet, on the Southern syde of the Kitchin - & tellt to them verie Playn that are they not allowed to cross the Chawk, or to tuche the Beest, to stroak its noase, or to upsett its Working in any Way - fore is it a Delicate Working, & nott to be Tampered or confused by Idlers. If they must bring their Dinnre, shale you allow no Drinks nor any pouring Foods to be brought withyn - & shale they remove their Shoes at the door shale you be particularly aware of Children, who are verie tempted to lean in & try to peer down into the Crack, to see if the Stories are true -

Tellt to them that if they try to spake wyth the Beest, that they shale not heer what they wish, in particular - fore it is not alyke to spaking wyth another Person - fore is the Beest verie Precise in its speech - & shale it only tellt the Troth.

- Shale you then release hys Ear, & tapp him upon hys Flank, that he shale go

**[97] A Laxative For The Shutling Of Poorly Thoughts**

Untill I dyd come to my Work, dyd I thynk it were only John who was brainsick - yett hafe I had so manie in these two Yeers Past, acoming to my Door - man & wo-man the Both - achuntering of what Terors they do see, in their Mynd, when they are Aloan and are they Idle - that dyd they heer Edie Halshams black hen callt them a murtherer in its crow, each Morn - or that they dyd leve some tapre smouldring in the floorrushes at the Mill & must they check twenty or thirty Tymes afore they do leve their work (can they not handle the Responsibility) -  or that they do seme to member tousling wyth Litle Margaret Vise, when were they watching her fore her Mother - though do they sware to God that neer would they do that - yett do they member their Hands doing it - & how many moar do not come, alyke Simon Awlbatch, up on the Moor - who knows what he is at amongst the stones - 

Shale they whyne of these Naughty Thinkings & spake that they hafe been Couzened by some Witch - & that hafe they tryed to wash the Spell out, or mede some litle Ritual or Prayer, spaking the Lords name a hundred tymes, in setts of Eight, afore Breakfast each Day - & shew you their Hands a-bleeding from the Soap, yet still unclene - Msr. Wainscote would callt of it an Epidemick, of untidy & blasted Mynds - some hafe gone to the almshouse in Nighcester - een dyd Msr. Knole send some there him-self from the Mill, in hys Charity - or to Dr. Quonby in their Distress - who has no Material Remedy fore them - yett does onlie sit & spake wyth them, as if they were a-Gossiping at the Market - making it Lax

Though shale I neer Complain to hafe John a-washing hys hands Well - could nott a sober Christian Pitty these Wretches - fore is it playn what the Cause be. Hafe I nott spake ten tymes in the Pamflet that all thought be the Mofement of Ayr - a <u>State Of Mattre</u>, would Msr. Wainscote spake - & what Beest has the Powre & the Cruelty to Mofe the Ayr in their Heads so - & trap Bubbles of it their, alyke in Glass - all difrent Weights - getting mixed up with Real Thoughts - & the moar do they Strugle wyth it - It is not God who has done thys to them - & shale nott God help them nor Release them - but onlie by thys Method, whych dyd I fyrst Work upon John, & dyd it Help hym some:

- Sit thee afore the Beest & Start him Up [3] -
- Hafe the subscryber entre the kitchin, & tellt to you some thyng that they do thynk on - & are they sure they dyd neer Do -
- Hafe the Beest shew to you its Console [5] -
- Upon the Console then meke you thys Operation -
- Plase you then the third fingre of your northern hand awtween the Beests eyes, or just abofe - 
- Askt you then to the Beest whethre the person dyd thys thyng - for example, <u>is Little Hannah Melsham styll lyving</u>, or <u>was Catherine Johnson a virgen on her betrothal</u> -
- Remofe your fingre then - 
- Shale the Beest then always spake the Troth of it - whethre it were Done or no - fore does it see the Troth of it, & the Evidense -
- If he dyd do thys Thyng, as the Beest spake, shale you send them from my Fathres House - & tellt the Constable of it, if you wysh -
- If they dyd not do thys Thyng, as the Beest spake, shale you View then the thoughts pass into the Beest - litle Lumpens apparating there upon hys Brow -
- Shall you shutle each one uppards then, apressting moast firm, until each are denatured & gone (fore is there no Brain in there to attach to) - 
- Then must the thought, thus denatured, be released: hafe the Beest shew to you hys Horns [5] - 
- Plase you anie of your fingres, of any cardinal hand, upon one of the Horns, & pullt uppard untill it does come Loose wythout Payn - & thus is the Thought gone - 

Spake to the subscryber that are they to Work hard, to forgett, & do not go Outsyde - where GRAVITAS shale onlie Finger their Trigger onse more -

**[98] For The Banishment Of Frickles, Towheads, Wens, Boyls, Whitlows, Moals & All Othre Blemiches**

As GRAVITAS does draw the Tydes up from the Sea, to drown villeges & children alyke - so shale he draw & send away foul liquids in the Skyn - fore is it much more Intelligent & Cruel to gife to men & wo-men the Hoap & then to Dash it, & cause discomfit -

If a subscryber comes to you & complains of some hideous blemich - & askt you if it be tuching of Toad (though why they would tuche a Toad I know not) gife to them thys simple Method:

- Sit thee afore the Beest & Start him Up [3] -

- Look you ovre the Beest's regions all, verie Closelie [5] untill you do find a ring of wens in some Clearing - though some may be in the depths of hys Hayrs - 
- Tuche at them wyth your Fingre, that they do Burst painless - & meke a Greaze upon your fingre - 
- Teke thys Greaze & meke of it a balsom, that shale you plase upon your kerchief -
- Teke the kerchief then & plase it presst upon the blemich of the subscrybre, fore at least ten Moments - & shale the Beests greaze calm GRAVITAS raysing, & meke it Lessre - 
- Shale you wype the excess from the creature using an Ajent [6] - 
- Spake you then AMEN, & is the rest done -

If anie wo-man comes & askt that you may meke thys Method baccards, that they may hafe a Blemich on their Cheak, do I trust that you should send such Addled girls away -

**A pennie**

**[99] Fore the cury of Hicketts**

Is the hicketts found the most amongst the Rich & babbies the moast - fore in their fyne Comforts of Lyfe do they guzzle & nuzzle so - spaking or crying too much - eating & drinking wyth great Gasps - & when they come to you fore their Cury shale they spake that it is verie Tortur - that does it presst within their necks alyke they are Dying -

Meke you then thys Method - 

- Sit thee afore the Beest & Start him Up [3] -
- Reed you then thys Greecke: SINGULTUS GLOBUS
- Hafe the Beest shew to you hys Cranking [5]
- Turnt the cranking northwards the onse, & then westwards the twice - 
- Had the beest shew to you hys Teats then [5] -
- Tuche the sixth, ninth & twelfth of them verie Lightly, & no othres - 
- Hafe the Beest shew to you then final hys Throte -
- Apply anie fingre to the throte then & hold it there, & reed thys Greecke three tyme - UNUMQUEMQUE
- Shale the Beest meke some litle Exhaust then - & shale you then know that is the hickett gone
- Shale you then final reed thys Greecke - ET IN ARCADIA EGO

**[102] To Let Out The Gowt & The Strangury**

Shale you have manie Civil men of the County (& some small amount of Wo-man all-so) coming upon you in strange Kidney - spaking that they do <u>feel Irish</u> (so they spake) & wyth verie great Soars in their Extreamitys, whych shale they pullt up their Truss to shew to thee: for some it may be their fingres, & othres their Noase - fore Msr. Wainscote was it always hys Leggs. Is this a verie auld distempre callt <u>the Stones</u> or <u>the Gravell</u> or <u>the Gowt</u> or <u>the Podagry</u> & by othre Names - & is it rare seen in the Comon Man yett onlie the Richest. Shale the Aflickted spake that they have have their Doctors to their Houses & do they tellt to them that they must meke Watre as much as they May. Tellt you to them that they must keap their Animal Liquids stoppaged up & meke them not - least of all shale they meke them not in my Fathres House. Is it the Troth that this aylment be caused by the Poysons a man carries in hys Watres - yett do the Doctors neer answre where those Poysons do come from. How might a Man manufecture them him-self - een if he is a mastre of hys Industry? Een a little Viewing tells that is it the work of GRAVITAS - fore lyke anie footman is jealous of those he Serves - of their fyne Vittels - of those thyngs he may onlie Mofe, & neer have to him Self. Thus does he fill a man alyke to a waterskin, wyth all the watres of the World - a fyne Poysoning. Askt of these Men - why do you thynk of these Reports that the level of the Seas do retreat each Year? Wherefore does that Water goes, & who does Deliver it? And shale they have their Trothfull Answre - 

Yet is the stoppage mede Right onlie by this most Easesome Method, applyed a numbre of Tymes - 

- Shale it work the Best when the kitchin is verie Cold -
- Meke you your hands verie clene, & the Beest all-so of anie Exhaust or Soiling ([4]) -
- Sit thee afore the Beest & Start him Up [3] -
- Shale you have the subscryber bring wyth them some piece of Finery, whych shale they place into the kerchief in your Hand - & shale you then plase both into the Mansion, fore that the Beest may see them. Fore thys is an ofranse to GRAVITAS - 
- Shale the Beest look upon it, & Consult, & tellt then to thee & the subscrybre whether GRAVITAS does Accept the Ofranse. 
- If GRAVITAS accepts, shale you Proceed - if he does Not, shale the subscryber meke anothre offering of a difrent Trinket, & bettre - 
- Reed you then this Greecke - INAEQUALIA FLUIDIS MOTU CORPORUM -
- Have you the Beest shew to  you hys Eastern flanks - & come verie Close ([4]) - & fynd you there a ring of Wens. Mayhap shale they be beneath hys Fur & Greazy - 
- Meke you in the Bowl a litle micsture of Decoction of Guinea, two palms of Salt & one of Sugare, & dipp thee the thumb of your Western hand withyn it -
- Teke that thumb then & rub it most vigourous about thys ring that it be Purged -
- Teke off your thumb then, & reed you this Greecke - ET IN ARCADIA EGO
- Clene you then your thumb upon the kerchief -
- Spake you the word AMEN then -

Shale the subscryber come less Aflickted in the Days that come, & for manie shale that be the End of it. For some, shale their Ofranse lose its lustre - as does it for all Covetous Men - & shale they need return wyth some greatre Prise -

**[164] For The Spinners Ear**

There is a Story amongst the Adled of thys Plase that when the Coton does come to the Mill in its Lumps, is it full of little Defils - come from that Plase callt India - & do they lofe to meke a House in the Ears - & shale you have so manie come to you & spake of <u>The Spinners Ear</u> - of a-changling that neer Ceazes in their Heads - that do sound alyke to a Person stood ahind them spaking the words <u>porridge & teachers</u> again & again. Meke no trying to tellt to them the Troth of it, fore shale they not care to hear it - that in the Mill, does GRAVITAS have no jobs to do - are all thyngs handled - & so does he Idle away the hours & interfere wyth the verie Ayr. Is he verie alyke a Child, on some Days - asticking his fingerless fingres awhere they be not Wanted - & through the openings of the head does he wedge such a combing of Items. Have I seen them, in Msr. Wainscotes glass, such that you could not believe - screws no longre than an eyelash, bits and motes, a whole Rubbish of tiny thyngs. And do these Foals meke it the worse - insiting to the foreman that the Windows are opened to the moor, to let the Ayr get to them - & all the untidyness that causes this poorly Condition. 

Are all thyngs a case of Mofement, in the right order - the mofement of the Right Ayrs. Thus, to ment it right -

- Shale thys only come good when is there no Wynd a-blowing through hys Fissure - 
- Sit thee afore the Beest & Start him Up [3] -
- Have the Beest shew to you its Console [5] -
- Upon the Console then meke you thys Operation -
- Come you down the Beests frame, past the Marks have I mede alyke thys (), untill you do fynd hys [body part] - whych in its Configuration shale tellt to you of the rightly Vurse for that Day - 
- Shale you then Consult of thys Table have I mede:
- Have the Beest shew to you its Eastern Handle, or fynd it your Self - 
- Teke your fingre & pullt out the Handle untill you do Hear a litle Clicking.
- Spake you then the Vurse verie Weakly, that the Table has tolt to you - 
- When is the vurse spake, shale you re-lease the Handle, & meke a Clapping of your hands -
- Is it done then, & the untidyness gone - spake you AMEN.

**[165] Fore The Scutchers Eye**

Is thys Aylment of syyany ill-named in these Partes - fore manie other than the Scutchers do gett it. Hafe I herd some spake that is it some exhaustion of the eye - what does Msr. Wainscote callt a <u>glow-coma</u> - whych is Caused by Looking too longly upon Cloath -. None has anie answre as to why have I not succumbed - though I were the best scutcher the Mill eer saw, fore near ten Yeer - 

Nay - is this caused by those who do Moon about in the Night, & do look up upon the Stars & the Planetes as does GRAVITAS mofe them - & as he does mofe them does he rayn litle Shards of them down upon the Earth - & into the Eye of any who should be Addled enough to be out & watching.

To remofe these Shards, use the folowing Method, though it must be done when the Room is verie Darkened, & is there no Moon shining through the Window -

**[365] To Meke A Stoppage of Tyme**

Is it no great Thyng to meke GRAVITAS shirk hys Duties - to meke hym Napp & Idle in the Sunn. Without hys Aplication, how mite the ayr mofe - how might Men spake - how might Planetts Tumble - how might Children stop their Stretching - how might Judges meke their Judgement - how might men and wo-men Fall - how mite any Tyme pass whateer - 

& in that long Moment when he Sleaps - & none else hapens beyond the Wals of the House - what could you get Done - what Afects could you meke - 

- Sit thee afore the Beest & Start him Up [3] -
- Teke the poynting fingre of your northernmost Hand, & apply it to the Creatures Exhaust, atween its Eyes -
- Mofe the fingre down from top to bottom, & reed thys Greecke - PARABOLA ECLIPTICAE
- Teke that fingre again to the Control atween its Eyes, & draw it down again, & reed that Greecke again - 
- Shale you do thys Seferal tymes, until the Beests Eyes come Cloased.
- Shale you cloase your Eyes all-so- 
- Teke you Marys Bels & ryng them - & shale thys have GRAVITAS come to sleap.
- Shale the Beest lye still then, & neer sleep -
- Shale you nott forget to ring the Bell a last tyme, when you are Finished - to have the World start again - 

**Five pense fore the stoppage of tyme for an Hour**
