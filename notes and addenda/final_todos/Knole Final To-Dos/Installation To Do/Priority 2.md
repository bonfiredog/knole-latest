 ## Priority 2 (Necessary, But Can Wait)
 -
 - Weather makes it more miserable, more likely to want to come in (drives)
 - - **RESPONDING TO CHARMS** - can it read them? Does it have individual responses?
 -  - - **BIRTHMARK AT TOP OF HEAD** (Robin's blood)
 -  - Create red marks (come up like bruises, less severe, come up more quickly (with fingertips), fade more quickly.
 -  - Winking (response)
 -  - More wen clusters and rings.
 -  - Caul in shot (well, just nub, no fur touching AND face detected) = shame
 -  - Setting zoom rate based on creature mood.
 -  - Make plot wound 1 bigger.
 -  - Create 'fish eye' when zoom in... (bring in candle flicker a bit more.)
 -  - Dripping blood from mouth and coughing blood when not well. 
 -  - - - **NIGHT-TIME GLINTING** - Actual light flashing, or a sprite? Happening randomly, only when zoomed out. Only in shot. At night. Grow from nothing, rotate, then grow TO nothing - very quick. Done as a light filter. Only in fur.
 -  - Cutting throat makes pitch go up. (permanently?)
 -  Making the MMM Sigil - what happens?
 -  Long speech (of any sort) gets a vocalisation
 -  If thirsty, it will ask for water. (a new sound) Make it thirsty in the morning.
 -  A second to wait after voice recognition, as it processes what it has heard.
 -  A little bit darker, overall?
 -  Open up the zoom view a bit (not quite so close?)
 -  More pressing needed for bruise.
 -  Maybe get rid of horn hold?
 -  Rub away other markings of Anne's?
 -  Make sigil mole taboo
 -  -  Fixing face sensitivity.
 -  - Repaint box for installation. (and cut out back?)
 -  - Make sure installation is working at Kaleider. Set up with cameras.
 -  - Get cables for touchscreen
- Buy new keyboard and mouse
- Get Ethernet Cable 
- - Candles leading you down stairs? (Buy a few more?)
- Using Anne Sigil makes you close to Anne (temporarily)
- - - **RECOGNISING MMM** from handkerchief. In OCR? How does it react? When it speaks, makes an MMM noise down in its throat. Saying MMM in throat when asleep? 
- - - Check the amount that emotions change facial expressions. 
- - Test - is a finger recognised through the kerchief?
- Set some cankers off the Caul, play with increase rate.
- Zoom speed tied to Triad
- Brows can be moved anywhere
- More splatter on wounds
- Make pores smaller
- When clip, hairs should be generated from hand, not top of screen. 
- Anger activation is not changing until some 'reset' occurs.
- Eyebrows are not changing with emotions.
- Making stains around mouth (random) when talking
- Sounds shake screen (scalar intensity)
- returns with blood around its mouth after moggrifying?
- Feather edges of bruises and red marks
