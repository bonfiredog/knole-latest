-------------------------------------

## REACTIONS

X whisper/shout in ear, 
X new phrase, 
X new face result
X touch taboo (is it going up too much?)

---

## DRIVES
- Test one by one.
- Decide on ritual drive -  is it in ritual hours, how do I feel, how resistant. 
- - Drive to zoom back out?
- Add weather badness to COMING TO GET IN.
 - Drive to get serviced (if lust hight and in favour). . -
 - Coming down and smelling things. (as a drive - if there is something to smell - doesn't always do it).
 - (Pain and fear makes it more compliant, more likely to go to Anne.) - how to implement?
 - Doesn't really do much at first - you're quite close to anne. Only decide to do drives if not closetoanne.

## OTHER
- Trust involved in triad as well.
- - Check all the recognitions. (Emotion, voice recognition, motion detection in 1 and 2, image and colour results, , face detection)
- - Test speakers
- Get/fix microphone?
-  Fix fragility of voice recog (testing).
- Zoom out filter not working
- Can still move with wet hand?
- Can move brows too far when dragging..
- - Check amounts - add multipliers to change emotion, internal states/concepts? Chance, Chance To RitualReact?
-  red mole  -Create schedule for it. Floaters go to him when at the eyes. Look through creature features - how does mole react? The other moles run away from the red mole.
-  Generate moles at start - don't alwyas draw 
-  Moles run away from cellar. - Moles reacting to pepper
-  Wounding makes them pull back more.
-  Mole shiver if wound is created, or creature vocalises.
-  Mole only runs to fur if it is not shaved?
-  - moles hide in fur when wind or sotrm.
-  the moles come out when there is a moon.
- - Moles: - If moon out, come north. If moon not out, go south. How high do they get? If within x px of bottom, stay to eat and never leave. MOLE reactions to body parts.
- Cleaning destroys player scent as well - only make scent if hand not wet.
- Avoid wens as well (moles)
- Taboo not a barrier
- Can go off edge of body.

## RITUAL COMPETENCES
- Dragging - resistance. (outside of ritual?) DRAGGING - Say tractato - and drag - no tuche for a few seconds stops this, and it responds as such. Can drag over fur,. going beyond taboo -  - Reacts against it. - Will allow you down if you taboo layers have low health.  Ability to go down is partly to do with physical state, partly to do with taboos. 
- - Taboos can only be cleaned by ajent/soaping
- TIME STOP RITUAL - stroking nose (makes sleepy) - starts to doze with it. Stops the bells. Lowers weather and wind sounds, particles, cloud movement. (this happens during sleep, as well.)
- PARABOLA ECLIPTICAE. Two bell rings wakes it up, and it starts to try to hold its breath, stop the wind and the clouds. Goes red. Starts to shake (holding breath mechanic). The bells stop sequence stops - gets out of time with the rest of the world. Three bells stop it (break out of ritual). Stop all weather.
- - SCHEDULE: Beest expecting work to begin at the sixth bell - gets happier if no work/face after sixth bell.
- REACTION TO HEARING THE WORDS ON THE EDGE OF THE CIRCLET: Set them as 'heard today'. New reaction (depends on opinion of Anne/player, with whether Anne ro player tied to Trust). cows it, makes it more compliant, makes a vocalisation?
- NOT READING THE WORDS IN THE MANSHION - if detected - shocked, surprised, scared, angry vs. intriguied, interested, happy (depending on triad/trust, and whether in ritual or not). Or coming forward?
- - **RECOGNISING BALLAD** - recognising individual lines? stanzas? the whole thing? How to do it as you are singing it? Just about constant, low noise?
- STARTING UP SEQUENCE - starting up the day as a whole sequence, initiated by hearing the word on the edge of the circlet. Whether it responds or not tied to trust etc. Does it respond to the Motto of God? The correct psalm - it sings the psalms back? Only at the right time?
- READING WORDS IN THE MANSHION - shocked/scared/surprised, very little, or interested, coming forward (a drive?). (depending on triad/trust, and whether in ritual or not).
- Eating moles hurts the creature.
- Current perceived hour
- Worse mood on saturday mornings (being put into ritual, being interacted with at all, really - a modifier?)
- **Daily Routine**: At night, will go away/sleep (based on drives) if not left. Eventually.
- the words for 'water'.
- How does it respond to these prompts OUTSIDE of ritual - won't do it, looks non-plussed?
- How does Beest inspeckt in ritual? much slower - In ritual, slowly look at manshion, nod once. Chance to make a noise when inspecting the manshion? In ritual, always look in mansion if something comes down.
- The psalms at certain times - does it recognise them? No, just expecting talking.
- ATTRAHO to come close, repulso to go away
- HAVING LUNCH EACH DAY Having lucnh - touching on forehead, holding it in place, then say motto of god - if hungry will react, will respond, get more irritable, start to shake? Goes away and eats. Does it come back on time? Depends on the internal state. Trying to go to eat as a drive. Ringing the bells before you go.
- Stop eating if hear loud noise. Ringing the bells to bring it back. Whether it comes back or not tied to internal state/triad.
- GOING TO BODY PARTS (list) - 'take me to the _______'. Does it resist these commands?
- terstimonium turns on light, par delictum turns it off. The light tickles/irritates?
Counting down makes it scared, changes internal state, emotions and triad? Each number makes it MORE scared?
- A slap only occurs with a single word.
- Leaving: Hearing the words, or hearing the words and 
- Hearing the words at right time - how does it respond? Will maybe complain if the nineteenth bell sounds, but tied to triad. Reacting to nineteenth bell - complaining, emotions go up? (reaction or drive?)
- Detecting ritual/touch/any interaction when not in day of work? How does it react to that? Surprise/pleasure/fear, depending on triad. No link to Anne (anne wouldn't do this)
- Reacting to Mary's Bells -  Makes him happy? Looking at the bowl? (tied to thirst)
- Asking to see places that are not revealed - 
- FLUIDIS SPHAERICO mekes your finger into soap. Soaping (and detergent) just stop spreading after a while.
- Servicing the grail - it starts to expect it. beest withdraws after being serviced - an orgasm reaction?
- surfactos etc. activates deterjent - lowers pain/fear etc, makes happier, more machine-like, fades wounds/makes them heal quicker. (stops after a little while?)
- Acutus to shave, acutus to stop.
- Beest makes a noisze when it has looked over something in the manshion
- When hear words from [x], and has seen something 
- Rare (red marks) - verie abstract shapes.
- recognising amulotts tiggers 
- Making the beest ejaculate involves just touching the different parts of the grail over and over - when lust is high - then it has an ejaculation, moves away/moves back. 
- funadmentum fluuidis pendulum moves it along/raises lust. Becomes quite sensitive/painful? Affected by the moon. 
- The word theorema is what starts it up. Don't do the light if touching horns. Downwards doesn't start the pulling, pulling only starts after a delay.
- THEOREMA - a grace period to hear this, then touch the horn (downwards) to start a spark? A random number needed, then kindles? No noise when it kindles, just the striking on the horns.
- MUSCULUS LONGITUDINIBUS  SCHOLIUM (Allow for all the names) - the Beest will make a noise, and show you the temple. Retreat back a little when you make that sigil...
- The operrayting in the moggrify makes one moal stop & vibrate. Any tuche near it makes the moal follow your finger anywhere. Stops after x time with no touches? Acutus acutum turns finger into a knife when touching this mole. It all-so gets the red mole, keeps him stuck there. When hear angustus artus, stops moving, stands still, and you can kill it. The Beest waits a moment, then backs out, nods etc and leaves.
- Ask a query - see amulott 9, when is ear is held and hear a question, then tap - disappear - random time? Tied to length of query?
- 72 - sigils (in general, and in ritual, make him aware and ready - the greecke here makes him present his mouth - 
- 73 - sigils (doesn't like the dead one as much) - recognise something in the manshion (comes down to it prepared) - when touch ear and whisper circumjovialium SYZYGIIS - after this disappear - after a random time, calls to them - and then responds to every piece of speech it hears (with slight delay). Come back on clapping of hands? 88 - heering the phrase, starts sniffing & looking for them, signals  then withdrsaws. If it reads sarah, matthew, marchand, mary, maria, caleb, it tries to find them but can't - has a reaction. 
- No drives in ritual.
- 97 - sigil, followed by touch, causes it to listen - when release again, disappears into its realm (nods once), then comes back very quickly and says 'nay, mistress' - then pull out the horn. Lumps going up? 
- With 97 sigil, tuching it near the eyes keeps it there. then let go, it disappears, then comes back and says something (expects its horn to be pulled out).
- Touching wens doesn't burst them - only when you say fluvia tangentas (for a little while) - gives it more wens - they spread - more dirty - 
- The cellar makes everything go crazy - make a list.
- finding a thing - goes away, and comes back, looking sheepish - angulumque sectori - worried about it. 
- Reaction to trying to reed something in the Manshion but it doesn't work. 
- What else cannot move back? Reaction
- 102 - making noises when it recognises an object in the manshion (in ritual)? When hear inaequalia fluidis, present the grail, Touching the nub REALLY gets the lust up (and the shame, if the right combo?). Don't go down to the mansion if eyes not in shot?
- 103 - recognise the amulet in weather (does this work?) - then pays attention to facial features. weather changes gradually. Just changes the current weather.Weather is INFLUENCED by modd always (Not completely changed) - this is just more extreme. Only applies to the current weather type.
- Asking to see stuff below - gets upset - reaction/resistance?
- 131 - hearing MOTU CORPORUM? How react?
- Add salt and sugar to the circlet diagram.
- 142 Hear curvatura parallaxin culculus, wait to recognise the card - alert - makes hand wet (keeps it so for a while) with "cankerjuice" - which spreads cankers.
- 153 - any of the sigils (the bad luck ones make it sad, the good luck ones make it happy) - 
- 154 - Ear in shot reactions when it sees the sigil? Has a chance to vocalise on ear pull in ritual?
- 154 - If in ritual and press eye duct the floaters start to respond to the words. Pick a random one. They start vibrating. Touch the eyes, causes a blink. 
- 176 - cutting with the final phrase in broaking of fleche.
202 - reacts to the dream speech (based on saying the greecke) - just sound being heard. Overrides normal reactions of heard sound.
- if inspect manshion (after no movement), do ocr?
- presenting throat in coughingcup (after recognising the sigil - reaciton to seeing things in the manshion?)
- cut can be made with the quickening greecke.
