 ## Priority 3 (Not Necessary, But Nice)
 - **FUR**: Any other fur templates? Add some more fur.
 - Other wounds on body? Hinting? Look up. 
 - Wen rate increase every time you touch it.
- **BLOWING**: Detecting it through voice recognition? Volume = intensity. While happening, interact with body parts (hair, eyes, nose, grail, others).
- - Chance to shed fur when shaking.
- Change opening phrase for debug.
- A few more cellar wens.
- Clouds don't move up and down and back and forth with floating.
- - ** Get rid of stains/dirt in rain?** Changing dirt number (every time raindrop hits), random chance based on intensity of weather, simulate the finger touching.
- - Fade out cloud alpha.
- Put gradient at top of cankers, if not done already.
- Sometimes shaking itself when it wakes up. 
- Making a loud noise when close shakes the furs.
- other markings on its body (cleanable?)
- Rain particles slightly faster
- Debug noises louder.
- Create surface for mouth drool?
- Floating hairs float quicker down.
- Clouds fade in from edge.
- Regrowing fur ups temperature.
- Shivering part-controlled by temperature.
- still getting blood stains when cutting (erroneous)
