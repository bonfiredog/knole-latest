Most followers in Skyrim are sexy dolls. DET focuses on elizabeth - graphical fidelity gets gendered!
DET - "another Bethesda game world evolves to suit modder's technology and tastes"
But are environments dehumanised without characters? Perhaps yes, but still characters

What does DET focus on?
In Alien Isolation, the creature. But the environment is also important.
Do we need humans to care about a landscape? Nature writing suggests not. It is a mode into which we can inject character, in the absence of anything 
In Skyrim focuses on enemies, sexy ladies, armour sets.
If you could interact with the environment a bit more, it would be OK not to hae other characters! Though, still, my interaction with the world is still far more naturalistic than with the characters.

No MAn's Sky is interesting - an enormous environment as character, presented - people are disappointed.

"Get outside!"

Though vilja is there as well, and Inigo - ppl want AI characters, the rest are 'marriagable, body changer in-game
